# Introduction to Learning Techniques:

There are various different tools that can be used to enhance learning, each of which are specific to the strengths and weaknesses of an individual. Generally the following are useful aids in improving learning.

- **Active Learning** 
	- *Active learning refers to engaging with material through practical application such as - practicing, problem solving or teaching others. These techniques can reinforce knowledge more than passive learning styles such as reading or writing.*
	- *Even if you ask questions and are wildly wrong, this form of learning is stronger than that of sitting back and just taking notes.*
- **Using Multiple sources of media.**
	- *Combining different mediums of learning can enhance understanding and figure out what works best for you - it also helps break up fatigue.*
	- e.g. reading a concept, watching a video on it, then physically practicing the skill.
- **Consistently sticking to a routine.**
	- Regular and consistent sessions of study, even if they are shorter, tend to be more effective than long and irregular sessions. Building your studying routine around your daily life fosters long-term success.
- **Self-Testing and Reflection.**
	- Testing yourself on your material by using quizzes, flashcards or by creates summaries is a great way to consolidate learning and find gaps in your knowledge.
- **Chunking**
	- By splitting large amounts of information into smaller chunks you can understand the smaller chunks before moving on to the next chunk which aids in understanding.
	- This particularly helps when dealing with large and complex subjects.
- **Spaced Repetition**
	- By revisiting material over increasing intervals you improve retention of information and memory.
- **Goal-Oriented and Focused Practice**
	- Setting a clear goal to work towards enables you to focus on areas that you need to look at or areas that you are struggling on.
- **Real World Application**
	- By applying the skills that you've learned through learning into the different avenues of your life, you strengthen the minds connection to the skill and build up your ability to problem solve.

The more key aspects to achieving results quickly are:
1. **Active Learning**
2. **Spaced Repetition**
3. **Self-Testing and Reflection**

In summary, you have various techniques which can be used to enhance learning, each with certain advantages. **The key message is that by spending some more time thinking, engaging and utilising the knowledge that we seek combined with a healthy routine which regularly reinforces ideas we are able to accelerate the process of learning.**

# Active Learning:

## Self-Explanation:

After reading concepts, explain them as if teaching another person - try to explain it in a simple manner, then more elegantly.

You then can answer the "why" and "how" questions that you might have with what you are looking at.

For example, answer the following questions out loud:

*Why does active learning improve learning retention and speed?*
*How can I use active learning techniques in my learning?*

This works because your brain is made to consciously process and organise the information in your head.
## Practice Problems and Exercises:

Apply your knowledge by solving problems with it, answering questions from others or completing tasks.

You can use practice problems from textbooks, online resources or creating your own questions.

This works to improve your ability to problem solve and gives your skills practical value in the real world.
## Active Recall:

Test your knowledge by recalling information without looking at any notes or aids.

You can test this by writing down the material that you need to remember and then attempting to answer them without any references. You can also close your notes and repeat concepts out loud.

This works because it improves memory by challenging your brain to recall information on the spot.
## Re-writing Notes:

You can summarise or condense notes into your own words.

By summarising chapters you can capture the main ideas of any test or article.

This helps you think critically about what you are reading and makes you internalise information.

# Spaced Repetition:

Simply using tools such as [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) can help you remember key concepts and drill things into your brain so that you can remember concepts and information off the top of your head.

Engage in regular practice each day to re-affirm concepts.

# Self-testing and Reflection:

## Self-Testing:
### Quizzing Yourself:

By writing questions based on the material that you are studying or by using other quiz methods you can cover key concepts, definitions and problems.

Giving each question a good go without any reference will strengthen the recall of information.
### Practice Tests:

Create mock tests that mimic the format of an exam or real-world scenario. You can impose time limits or deadlines to enhance focus and intensity.
### The Feynman Technique:

By explaining a concept in a very simple manner as if teaching it to somebody who knows nothing you can identify shortcomings in your understanding and eventually fully explain advanced topics in a simple manner.

This helps with your communication skills, especially in work environments, where people will not have the same level of skills or experiences that you have.

### Write Summaries:

By summarising material from memory, then comparing it to your actual notes, you can see how much you retained or missed and then clean up any mistakes.

### Ask the "Whys" and "Hows":

Ask questions that can expand your knowledge of a concept:
- Why does this work?
- How does this connect to other ideas?
- What happens if this is changed?
## Reflection:

### Review Mistakes:

After completing tasks, analyse where you went wrong. Ask questions such as:
1. Where did I go wrong?
2. What can I do to avoid this again?

You can then write down any corrections and save them for any future sessions so that you can look upon them and figure out what not to do.
### Learning Journal:

After a session or a day of work, you can write down entries in a journal or book about:
1. What you learned today.
2. What you found challenging.
3. How you can improve your approach next time.
### Connecting New Knowledge to Old:

After assimilating new material, you can relate that material to what you already know. This can be done by asking questions like:
- How does this expand or challenge my previous understanding?
- What are the similarities or differences between this and other topics?

### Evaluate Your Study Approach:

Reflect on if what you are doing is effective or ineffective. e.g.
- What worked well?
- What was unsuccessful?

Then you can adjust your strategy to fit your needs.

## Combination of Both:

After testing or practicing material, analyse the following:
1. Which questions/tasks were easy? Why?
2. Which questions/tasks were hard? Why?
3. Did you rely on memory or did you fully understand the concept?

# Unsorted Concepts:

## Spaced Repetition:
- Instead of cramming, spreading learning over time
- Systematically reviewing material at increasing intervals
- Particularly powerful when combined with active recall
- Based on Hermann Ebbinghaus's "forgetting curve" research
## Interleaving:
- Mixing different but related topics/problems during study
- For example, practicing different types of math problems in random order rather than blocked practice
- Helps develop better discrimination between concepts
- Makes initial learning harder but improves long-term retention and transfer
## The Generation Effect:
- Learning is stronger when you generate your own answers/explanations
- Creating your own examples
- Solving problems before being shown the solution
- Writing predictions before reading explanations
## Dual Coding:
- Combining verbal and visual information
- Drawing diagrams while learning
- Creating mental images to accompany concepts
- Based on Allan Paivio's work showing we process visual and verbal information through different channels
## Elaborative Processing:
- Creating meaningful connections to existing knowledge
- Asking "why" questions
- Relating new information to personal experiences
- Creating analogies and metaphors
## Calibration:
- Accurately assessing your own level of understanding
- Using practice tests to identify knowledge gaps
- Avoiding illusions of competence from passive review
## Concrete Examples:
- Moving from abstract concepts to specific examples
- Creating multiple diverse examples
- Understanding boundary conditions (when concepts do/don't apply)
