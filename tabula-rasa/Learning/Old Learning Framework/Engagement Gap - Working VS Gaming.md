# Making Work More Engaging (3 Critical Steps)

1. Set clear mini-goals with defined "win conditions" and visible progress trackers.
	1. *Start each work session by writing 2-3 specific achievements you want to complete in the next hour*
2. Use time-boxing techniques with small rewards after completion.
	1. *Set a timer for 30-45 minutes of focused work, then take a 5-10 minute break to do something enjoyable*
3. Create accountability through regular check-ins with colleagues.
	1. *Join or create a small "accountability pod" where you share daily goals via message in the morning and results in the evening*

# Making Video Games Less Appealing (3 Critical Steps)

1. Set strict time limits and remove auto-save features
	1. *Only play one run at a time, then evaluate if I have time for another run or if I have to do something else, If I've been sitting down for more than an hour its time to do something else.*
2. Disable notifications and reward animations in game settings
	1. *Only playing single player games to remove notifications and rewards since they are generally more present in multiplayer games, this also hits on the social aspect.*
	2. *Limiting exposure to the wider scene.*
3. Introduce artificial friction (extra steps before gaming, physical separation from gaming setup).
	1. *Only playing video games after I've done my lifting and daily steps.*
