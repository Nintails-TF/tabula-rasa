# Framework Summary
## Foundation: Hierarchy of Learning Needs

1. **Physiological Needs**: Sleep (7-9 hours), nutrition, exercise, hormonal balance, 
2. **Safety and Security**: "Good enough" environment, psychological safety, stable emotional state, manageable stress.
3. **Cognitive Resources**: Attention capacity, mental energy, working memory.
4. **Higher Order Function**: Executive function, Metacognition, Critical Thinking, Abstract Reasoning, Complex problem solving, future thinking, social cognition, self-awareness, etc.

## Core Learning Techniques

### Active Learning
- **Self-explanation**: Explain concepts in your own words without references
- **Practice problems**: Apply knowledge through solving problems
- **Active recall**: Test knowledge retrieval without aids
- **Generation effect**: Creating your own examples/answers strengthens learning

### Spaced Repetition
- Review material at increasing intervals (use tools like Anki)
- Based on the forgetting curve research
- Systematically scheduling reviews for optimal retention

### Self-Testing and Reflection
- **Quizzing**: Create and answer questions on key concepts
- **Practice tests**: Simulate exam conditions
- **Feynman Technique**: Explain complex concepts simply
- **Learning journal**: Document insights, challenges, and improvements

### Supporting Techniques
- **Interleaving**: Mix related topics rather than block-studying
- **Chunking**: Break complex information into manageable pieces
- **Dual coding**: Combine verbal and visual information
- **Elaborative processing**: Connect new information to existing knowledge

## Practical Learning Protocol
1. **Before learning**: Set explicit intention ("After this session, I will be able to explain/understand/create using ___ concept")
2. **During learning**: End-of-section checks (write main points, identify confusions, create examples)
3. **After learning**: Explain everything you know without reference, compare to source material, fill knowledge gaps.
