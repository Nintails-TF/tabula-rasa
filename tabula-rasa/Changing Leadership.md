# Changing Leadership

So human elements in work are being lost as we are obscured and lost through technology? That this is done because it is the most profitable and because those who are elite need to beat those who are also elite so that they don't lose their own power or positions.

I mean, I can only see it continuing unless external forces intervene. Those who are strong want to remain strong and want to remain rich and successful, those who are weak want to become strong and be rich and successful. People are self-interested in what help themselves, their friends, their family.

It's different than the past - whilst people did get dehumanised, there was the appearance of care and compassion within communities and workplaces, there was connections that could be made then leveraged into growth, now that process has been slowed down for those at the bottom level as they spend years slaving to a computer before anyone cares about them - IF those in charge end up do.
