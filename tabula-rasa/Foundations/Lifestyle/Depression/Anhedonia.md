# Anhedonia

Anhedonia means to feel a reduction/inability to feel positive emotion towards things that would normally spark joy or pleasure in a person.

It mainly occurs in MDD (Major Depressive Disorder), but can also occur with Schizophrenia, substance abuse, PTSD, and Parkinson's Disease. 

## Dealing with Anhedonia:

### Behavioural Activation:

Behavioural activation therapy is the main technique used in clinical environments to help those suffering from anhedonia.

The main principle is that: ***Action can precede motivation.*** That if we stick at doing things that could be positive despite not feeling motivated, that the regular response can be triggered again.

It is structured like so:
1. Monitoring mood and activity. (1 Week)
	1. Track daily activities in a log, stating time, activity, duration, and mood (1-10)
	2. Note activities that provide pleasure, achievement, or connection.
	3. Note patterns of avoidance or withdrawal.
2. Assess values
	1. Figure out core values in different domains of life.
		1. Relationships, education, health, leisure, personal growth, etc.
3. Activity Planning
	1. Create a balanced list of activities.
		1. Achievement (Tasks, work, chores)
		2. Provide potential pleasure (hobbies)
		3. Involve connection with others (Social events)
	2. Start with small and achievable things.
4. Graded Task Assignment
	1. Break big tasks into small steps.
	2. Schedule tasks for specific times.
	3. Do easier tasks before hard ones.
5. Consistent Implementation
	1. Follow schedule even when motivation is low.
	2. Use reminders, alarms, and/or accountability partners.
	3. Focus on completing a task rather than how you feel about it.
6. Review and Adjust.
	1. Review at the end of the week any progress or challenges.
	2. Increase difficulty as you build momentum.
	3. Notice and celebrate small improvements.
