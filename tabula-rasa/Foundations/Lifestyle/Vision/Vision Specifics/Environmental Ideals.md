# Environmental Ideals:

In other words, what kind of environments enable me to cultivate myself?

## Protocols:
- *My personal space should be clean and ordered.*
	- *Be it my personal room or space at an office or library.*
- *If I'm working, I should place myself in an environment where other people are also doing work.*
- *Offloading as much mental tax as possible to visual calendars, reminders or tools will help me think clearly and stay focussed.*
- *I don't need to chat to people all the time, but saying a few words here and there helps me feel heard in my environment.*
	- *Hopefully the words are meaningful and valuable, if they aren't that's OK too.*
- *Avoiding sitting for more than 2 hours at a time.*
- *At least once per week, get out and see some nature, even if it is just the local park.*
- *Listen to my body, If I'm too hot find a way to reduce the heat and vice versa.*
- *Don't load my brain with lots of audial stimulus, minimal music and ambience. At least when trying to focus and work on things.*

## Mental Aspects of Environment:
- I do better in environments that are structured and regimented rather than free and flexible environments. 
	- Doesn't mean I don't like being independent, things just have to be measured and deliberate.
- Having visual structure in my environment helps.
	- e.g. My calendar helps me keep track of what day it is, having my watch on me helps me keep track of the time, so my brain is freed up to focus on other things.
- I perform better when I'm around other people but not constantly interacting with them.
	- It holds me accountable to my behaviour.
- I like talking in small groups or 1-on-1, but not large groups or trying to deal with chatterboxes.

## Physical Aspect of Environment:
- Cool temperatures work best, I can't focus as well If I'm either too cold or sweating my balls off.
- Quiet ambience is nice when working, I do like pure silence sometimes, but other times it can be a bit dull.
- Bright, clean and clear spaces work best, as I can find what I need right away and I appreciate the simplicity and lack of visual noise.
- I don't enjoy sitting down for more than 1-2 hours at a time. I get restless.
- Natural light helps and so does a bit of nature. 
	- Metropolitan hellscapes don't excite me.
