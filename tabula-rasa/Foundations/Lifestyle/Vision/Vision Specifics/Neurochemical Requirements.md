# Analysing My Depression:

## Protocols:
- *Avoid cheap sources of dopamine that blunt reward sensitivity.*
	- *Video games, Social media, Binge-watching, Binge-reading slop.*
	- *Remove sugary foods, processed snacks, alcohol and drugs.*
- *Do hobbies that require effort and have delayed gratification.*
	- *Exercise, reading, working, creative activities, etc.*
	- *Reading is good as it stimulates the mind and can enhance empathy and perspective.*
- *Daily exercise (30-60 mins per day) supports the release of helpful chemicals such as dopamine, testosterone and increases mood/neurogenesis.*
- *7-9 hours of sleep with consistent wake up and sleeping times is **highly beneficial.**
- *Any sort of work that requires memory, focus or executive function.*
- *Journaling helps the brain process emotions and can reduce worry/anxiety.*
	- *Same with meditation.*

## Genetic Component:

Gene studies or GWAS (Genome-wide association study) data links 178 gene variants linked to major depression. But this shit is way above my paygrade and is complex and polygenic. (https://news.yale.edu/2021/05/27/roots-major-depression-revealed-all-their-genetic-complexity)

In essence, it is estimated that 40% of the risk of depression (MDD) is attributed to genetic factors whilst the other 60% is influenced by environmental factors/life experiences. (https://www.psychiatryonline.org/doi/pdf/10.1176/appi.ajp.163.1.109)

*Interestingly, women appear to be more at risk with a 42% link of heritability compared to men of 29%, suggesting that men suffer from depression more due to environmental factors.* 

Could be a wide reason of factors why this is the case.
### Brain Chemistry:

Depression is historically linked to an imbalance in neurotransmitters, messengers like serotonin, norepinephrine and dopamine. Chemicals play a role, but depression is a neural circuit of dysfunction, rather than a chemical imbalance.

Basically, the brain isn't functioning optimally. But since the brain is plastic, it can be rewired, strengthen and repaired.

Brain changes also occur especially with regions of the brain that control mood regulation and cognitive function. With a reduction in grey matter in the prefrontal cortex and the hippocampus, which impairs decision-making, memory and emotional responses.

CRT (Cognitive Remediation Therapy) is designed to enhance brain function by performing tasks and exercises that target the areas of deficit.

Exercise is shown to increase neurogenesis and aid brain health. Diet and sleep also play a big role.

Mentally, you can perform tasks that activate the brain, like puzzles, problem solving, reading, language learning, etc. Meditation also works to increase grey matter.

The problem here is that this the reward system is blunted, there is more of an emphasis on quick hits of dopamine because their brain's reward system is blunted.

Also constant digital stimulation hurts the brain - e.g. brainrot - as it reduces dopamine, which is harmful especially in those who are depressed.
## Treatment of MDD:

Depression is a mostly heterogeneous disorder, meaning that there is a wide range of symptoms and outlets.

CBT doesn't have a lot of research behind it because it is difficult to quantify the value of it.

But studies have shown that CBT can be as helpful as SSRIs - but requires a skilled professional. It's probably more accurate to say that unless you find a very good therapist or councillor that clicks with you, therapy is probably not going to do shit. (https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/article-abstract/208460)

A combined approach of both CBT and SSRIs as a first protocol, is generally a good and safe way to treat depression.

Though, CBT doesn't work well for me, as when I'm distressed I lose sight of the techniques. Also sitting around and talking about things seems like a waste of time to me. Physical exercise helps more, must be the male part of my brain talking. It just makes me feel good and makes me feel loose and relaxed after.

SSRIs help, but I don't want to rely on them forever, once things get a bit more settled for me I want to get off them.
