# Introduction:

When doing anything related to gaming, there are important factors to include outside of actually playing and practicing - do note, that the skills listed are not just limited to gaming, but can help you with other activities too - e.g. work, school, hobbies, etc.

I want to stress one point in particular:

==***Sometimes the best way forward, is to take a step back.***==

When I say this, I mean that mainly it is important to take breaks and to not train too hard all at once. ==**What you do outside of the game, is just as important if not more important, than what you do inside the game.**== There is nothing wrong with taking breaks or cutting a session short.

With this preamble out of the way, I'd like to start explaining my key ideas on how to have success whilst gaming and playing for improvement.

***
## ==1. Health is Your Number One Priority==

Having gone through the pain of having carpal tunnel in both my hands and wrists, I will always advocate for you taking care of your health above all. It is important to listen to your body and not ignoring any early signs of pain or fatigue.

If your approach to gaming is causing any of these issues:
- Physical pain or strain in the body.
	- Repetitive strain injuries
	- Posture issues
	- Eye strain or fatigue
- An excessively unhealthy or sedentary lifestyle.
	- Unhealthy eating.
	- Poor hydration.
	- Sleep problems.
	- Lack of exercise.
- Contributing to excessive mental or emotional pain.
	- Serious neglect of key responsibilities.
		- Work, School, Relationships, etc.
	- A toxic and miserable environment.
	- Addiction and being "unable to stop playing"

I recommend that you modify your current approach and seek help from the people around you and even professional help from GPs, therapists, physiotherapists, etc. If the problems are severe or reoccurring.

***It is always easier to deal with a problem whilst it is small, then letting it grow into a behemoth.***

So seek help early - even if the issue is small, better to spend 50 minutes now, rather than 50 hours later.

## 2. Define Your Definition of Success:

If you have a poor goal or no goal at all, how will you know when you have succeeded? 

Winning and losing matches isn't always within your control, so they aren't a good metric to measure success, you will also have slumps and peaks which aren't directly within your control. You don't wake up and say "Ah I'm going hit all my shots today", but you put the processes in place which enable you to reach that state more often and vice versa.

Shifting your mindset from **I want to win this game** (Outcome oriented) to **I want to play to improve my skills so I can reach my goal.** (Process oriented). 

Try to maintain a growth mindset. There are times where you will want to focus on winning an important game, but 90% of the time, you want to focus on learning and developing your skills. (If that is your goal)

When constructing a goal keep it SMART:

- Specific
	- What needs to be done?
- Measurable
	- Set a measurable benchmark which can be tracked over time.
- Achievable
	- What can you reasonably achieve given your current skills, ability and time.
- Relevant
	- Why do you need to do this thing? Look at the bigger picture.
- Time-sensitive
	- What is the given time frame of this activity?

I believe that it is best to have a **long-term vision** that has many relevant **short term goals** that act like smaller steps to achieve your vision. Lets look at how we can look at simple visions and statements, then enhance them to get a better picture of what we need to achieve.
### Constructing a Vision:
Long term vision - *I want to play in premiership / I want to be top 500 / I want to be radiant*
Short term goals - *Get better mechanics/gamesense*

OK - Let's start to apply SMART principles.

**Specific:** *I want to play flank scout in premiership. I want to focus on my mechanics and gamesense, since these are weaknesses of mine.

**Measurable:** I will monitor my mechanics by looking at my accuracy stat, I will get reviewed by a mentor to find out where my weaknesses in my gamesense are.

**Achievable:** I'm aiming to improve my average accuracy by 2-3% from an average of 67% to 70%, I also want to be able to rotate to my medic when my pocket scout dies without thinking about it and to make sure I call when I'm going to make a play and that it is a good timing.

**Relevant:** By developing these skills, I will hit harder in fights, ensure my medics safety whenever I can and prevent myself from feeding.

**Time-sensitive:**
The timescale I have to develop these skills is 1-2 months, where I'm scrimming 3 nights per week, practicing and pugging 2 nights per week and resting for 2 nights. I will check in with my mentor each week to look at a demo.
### Rinse and Repeat:

As you can see, now we have a much more concrete goal to work towards. Now this may just be one step in order to reach our vision, but by taking these steps then making new targets, we can reach our vision. 

**Even if the goal isn't perfect - simply having a bit of direction and focus can do wonders.**

Once we set a target, work towards it, check the results if it worked or not. You would take that feedback and either keep working towards it, develop a new skill or change your priorities.

You can also set different SMART goals in tandem, but make sure to factor that in when being realistic with your time management, e.g. If you have 3 different goals, give yourself some more time. *This is a good idea, so that you don't get bored practicing the same skill every session.*

**SMART goals are great, because they shift you to value enhancing your skills and abilities rather than raging about short-term wins and losses. Even if you don't hit your goal.**
## 3. Keep a Routine that is Inline with Your Vision:

Now that you have a SMART goal to aim towards. You need to develop a practice schedule so that you can target these areas. When constructing a practice routine, consider the following factors:

- Be realistic.
- Quality > Quantity.
- Consistency is key.
- Don't overwork yourself.

## 4. Start Small and Add when only Necessary or Ready

Trim all of the possible fat from your practice, look at lean manufacturing, that was first used within Toyota in the 1950s and 1960s and the 7 wastes:

1. **Waste of superfluous inventory and raw material**
	1. *Wasting practice time and energy*
2. **Waste of overproduction**
	1. *Overtraining and spamming games*
3. **Waste of over-processing**
	1. *Honing skills unnecessarily and training too much to reach beyond the standard of your goal or the standards of yourself/team.*
		1. *e.g. Playing to be the "carry" rather than being a good player.*
4. **Waste of transportation**
	1. *Not getting everything setup and ready before you start training.*
		1. *Get your water, music playlist, eat a snack before hand, do your chores.*
5. **Waste of excess motion**
	1. *Developing inefficient practices and habits before finding the optimal or at least very strong method.*
6. **Waste of waiting**
	1. *Not using downtime effectively.*
		1. *When you are in queue, refill water, stretch your hands, boot up aim trainer, whatever works for you.*
7. **Waste of making defective products.**
	1. *Accepting poor practice techniques and behaviours to persist and become an automatic part of your play, leading you to need to "unlearn" bad habits.*

## 5. Avoid harmful habits:

Sometimes winning and improving just involves not doing something that is neglectful, if you can turn up for practice and not do these things, you'll be fine:

- Smurfing
	- It's OK to have multiple accounts if you want to work on developing a new skill in an easier environment. But, if you don't have a **REALLY good** reason to smurf, then its only going to hurt you, because you aren't playing against the strongest players you can play against at your current level.
- Spamming too many games.
	- You will get better if you play a lot, but at a certain point, you will completely burnout and be working at 5-10% of your max and you'll not be learning or developing as a player efficiently. You also run the risk of injury, health problems and/or long term burnout.
		- e.g. You as a non-valorant pro are playing 12+ games per day. 
- Fucking around
	- Don't just play random gamemodes, classes or casual modes without any intent. If you or your team needs to develop a certain skill, you should primarily focus on that. Keep an eye on your goals when you are playing.
		- E.g. as a pocket scout player for your team, you shouldn't spent time playing sniper in PUGs.
- Tilting and raging
	- If you are getting mad or tilted, don't rage-queue or start flaming randoms. Take a break, get some water, recharge, etc.
		- Good players don't type. Content creators type and farm rage for clips.
- Watching YouTube/social media/playing other games.
	- You are just wasting your practice time and free time that you have.
