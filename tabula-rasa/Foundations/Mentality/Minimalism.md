# Minimalism:

*Find the essentials that need to be done and complete them before moving to greater things. With this approach you build a healthy foundation in which you life lies upon. Without it you are building a house on a bed of sand.*

This is similar to **Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs.**

The core concepts of a persons life, in the modern era, are the following.
### Physiological Needs:

This in essence is the most basic and core of needs of humans, they are needed to live and survive.

- Hydration
	- *Without water, you ability to do anything comes to a screaming halt.*
- Hygiene
	- *Without proper hygiene, the odds of illness and infections rises.*
- Nutrition
	- *Without a solid balance of carbs, fats, proteins and other micronutrients. Your body will suffer from various maladies and pains.*
- Shelter
	- *Without sufficient shelter, proper rest becomes difficult and outside environment will drain you.*
- Sleep
	- *Without sleep, your body and mind will not be able to recover properly.*
- Healthcare
	- *If you don't have access to healthcare and you get sick, you just need to deal with the negatives of your illness, which can potentially be fatal.*
- Exercise
	- *Without exercise, your body will be prone to more pains and your health will be worse.*

### Mental Needs:

Once your physical needs have been addressed, you have to deal with any psychological or mental needs.

- Emotional Regulation
	- *You have to process your emotions in a healthy way to prevent emotional breakdowns or distress.*
- Challenge
	- *You have to have something that challenges you and keeps you learning, this keeps you cognitively stimulated, preventing mental stagnation.*
- Resilience
	- *You have to be able to bounce back from setbacks, as you will fail you need to be able to cope with it and learn.*
- Stress Management
	- *You need effective strategies to keep stress at a manageable level. As chronic levels of stress lead to physical and mental burnout.*
### Social Needs:

After you a physically and mentally fit, your social needs are next up to being addressed.

- Validation
	- *You need a sense that your efforts or existence are worthwhile. As if you don't you can end up depressed, this can be external or internal.*
- Communication
	- *You need to be able to express your own needs and understand others. As if you don't you can't get the things you need to survive or respect others survival needs.*

A key reason behind why I'm depressed is that I don't have a keen sense of internal validation and I don't have a support network of friends that can give me external validation. My family can give me external validation, but only when I'm around them.

1-2 meaningful interactions per week are needed for a person to avoid psychological decline. They do not need to be long or complicated, but they do need to be authentic. There are various methods, such as:

1. Engaging in a shared activity with others.
2. Having an online connection.
3. Supportive gestures.
4. An expression of gratitude or complement.
