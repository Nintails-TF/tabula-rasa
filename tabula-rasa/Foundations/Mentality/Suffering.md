# Jakob and Adam

Jakob's story illustrates the difficult paradox you're contemplating. He achieved extraordinary athletic success - double Olympic champion, multiple world titles - while allegedly enduring a childhood and adolescence marked by control, fear, and abuse.

I guess what you said is true. I had a friend called Adam when I was younger, and his parents pushed him into swimming, he was really good at it, but never got above that national level. Then you saw as he got older and into his teenage years that he got angry and mad at losing the slightest thing, a board game or a game of football, he would be raging if he lost rather than crying about it when he was younger. The parents are divorced now, but sometimes I think about Adam. What causes the case with Jakob being an Olympian and my friend Adam, what's the difference here?

I want to know why the same water that can harden the egg, softens the potato. In a sense. I know that there also have been cases where greatness is cultivated in a normal and supportive way like Magnus Carlsen.

When we are stuck in these environments that are hellish:
1. Create internal space
2. Find meaning in suffering
3. Gain small moments of choice and autonomy
4. Compartmentalise your life beyond the current situation
5. Orient yourself towards the future
6. Learn what battles to fight and when to concede
7. Find people to connect to.

Let's say that somebody is half-twisted. That they have the capacity for greatness, yet also have a deep desire to watch the world that wronged them burn into ashes. That they care for their fellow man out of utility and that they can empathise but don't let emotions take over. A cruel poison of a snake, that eyes up and coils around prey.

These people are drawn towards:
- **High-stakes, winner-take-all domains** - Finance, high-level politics, certain entrepreneurial spaces, elite athletics
- **Crisis-oriented fields** - Emergency medicine, disaster response, wartime leadership
- **Creative industries with cult-of-personality dynamics** - Film, fashion, certain artistic movements
- **Revolutionary or disruptive organizations** - Where breaking norms is valued over social cohesion
- **Shadow systems** - Intelligence agencies, certain legal practices, corporate raiders

Organisations unconsciously select these kinds of people as the light cannot function in these environments. You have a person who is smiles on the surface, but has that demon tucked behind the surface, with words, speech, and action that leak of brimstone from time to time.

The truly scary people are not those who fight the institution or have emotional outbursts against it, but those who silently undermine it with complete deniability and coolness.
