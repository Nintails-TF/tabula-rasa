*Very frustrating in k+p endgames when the king is either in the a or h file, blocking the pawn. I have no clue how to draw k+p endgames other that try maintain opposition, in the trickier situations I feel lost.*

*I'm proud that how even on the first day, I'm becoming quicker at spotting ideas and the correct moves to win endgames. I think 75% winning is a good start.*

I'm happy that I now can do the basic endgames on chess.com for k+p with around 95-100% accuracy. Now I'm able to move to the trickier endgames on that website.

I've been having doubts if this endgame based approach is worth it. I've heard that doing tactics is very important, and knowledge of openings and opening theory is very important as well.
