We are transferred to a webpage with the following:
![image1](../../../_resources/image1-236.png)

We know that the source code has an image in it.
![image2](../../../_resources/image2-193.png)

By changing the location of the address to this *background.png* we get the flag:
![image3](../../../_resources/image3-152.png)

^FLAG^25a27f05f776af3d190ca3d4191ea6b20d096c9f4494e662f506f5fd9fb85316\$FLAG\$
