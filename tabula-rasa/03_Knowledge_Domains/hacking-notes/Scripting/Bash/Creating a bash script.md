Creating Symlinks:

Test script:
![image1](../../../_resources/image1-1.png)
After writing a script you can access it from anywhere after doing the following:

1.  Navigate to /usr/local/bin
2.  Execute: sudo ln-s /full/path/to/your/file /usr/local/bin/name_of_new_command
    1.  ![image2](../../../_resources/image2-1.png)
3.  Make your script file an executable.
    1.  ![image3](../../../_resources/image3.png)

I now have two links - **academyVPN and htbVPN** which connect to my vpns.
