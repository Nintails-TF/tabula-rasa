Intro:

I define god-tier tools that are basically going to be evergreen in the way that they will **ALWAYS** be relevant and useful on a regular basis.
- cURL
  - *Extremely useful to bring HTML content into the terminal for testing and for looking at.*
- *Grep*
  - *Powerful filtering tool - helps you look for the stuff you care about and removes the fluff.*
- *sqlmap*
