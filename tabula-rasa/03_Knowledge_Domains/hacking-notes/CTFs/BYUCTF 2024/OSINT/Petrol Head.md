When does the registration on this car expire?

`MJ05 XRL`

Format your answer as `byuctf{MM/DD/YYYY}`

***
If you aren't sure what country the number plate is from use this: https://www.ofesauto.es/en/know-the-possible-nationality-of-a-vehicle-by-its-plate-number/

You can go to Gov.UK to lookup cars in the UK, which shows if the car is Taxed or when its MOT is due.
