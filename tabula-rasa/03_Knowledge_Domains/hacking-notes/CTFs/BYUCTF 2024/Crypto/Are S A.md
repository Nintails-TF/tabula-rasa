Found these keys... wonder what they do...
***
We are given a file that has various values for n, e and c.

These are normally used within the RSA cryptosystem. Where:

- n
	- Is the modulus or the public key
- e
	- Is the public exponent or encryption exponent
- c
	- Is the ciphertext

The ciphertext is build by doing the following - `c = m^e mod n`

We can use the tool: https://github.com/RsaCtfTool/RsaCtfTool
