The title refers to Ps and Qs? Mabey they are critical letters in this puzzle? We know that due to the hint around 100 bits were used to encrypted the data. Firstly, what is RSA?

Defining RSA:

RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) is a public key cryptosystem used for secure data transmission. It uses both a public and a private key. The public key is known by anyone and is used to encrypt messages, the private key d (n in the decryption process)

C = ciphered text
N = two prime numbers multiplied together.
M = represents the message
E = represents the public key
D = the private key

We know that:

Ciphered text = c
Public key = e
Two prime numbers = N
