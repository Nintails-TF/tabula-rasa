Sometimes, we also need to spawn our own targets, interactive sessions either have a Docker target, single VM or multi VM targets.

Docker Targets use the form of  

and you are usually able to just quickly click on the docker link.

When targeting a single VM, you spawn the target by clicking on a link. Often these systems require you to authenticate using credentials. If you don't have any credentials then you must attack the target from an authenticated standpoint.

You'll need to download a VPN key then use your machine to interact with the target.

(You don't need to bother with spawning a pwnbox or anything like that, it's just how HTB makes cash from noobs)

More On Modules:

Modules are aimed at teaching specific topics (like enumeration via nmap). All modules require cubes to be unlocked. You get cubes by passing and answering questions in interactive sections or by buying them.

So the main method about these would be to complete all tier 0 modules. Then move onto Tier 1 modules. The higher tiers are usually bigger courses and are more complex, it doesnâ€™t mean that they are way harder though.

Many modules have a final skills assessment in which you need to access a separate target host and use the skills learned in the course to exploit them, so that you can earn the full amount of cubes.
Academy Lessons are structured like so:

**Paths** refer to collections of modules that try to teach a specific skill.

**Modules** focus on specific topics, tools or skillsets. These are often scenario based and simulate real world examples, making them very useful for new students in infosec.

**Sections** are the meat of the modules and contain the subject matter being taught, relevant commands and hands on exercises.

You are able to spawn a Linux OS (Parrot OS) which can be used to answer exercises. Certain sections also have cubes. Or are known as **interactive sections**, they require answers to be given and the workstation to be used.

(Be careful, as a free user, you only get 1 spawn of a 2hr session per day! So make it count)

Pick your Path:

Paths are sets of modules that build up broader topics, some a zero to hero modules, but others are smaller and discuss a specific topic.

E.g. "Junior Penetration Tester" would be 0 to her0 and "Linux Fundamentals" would be a smaller path.

Paths often have similar entry level modules that are required to progress, so again working on fundamental skills are important.
