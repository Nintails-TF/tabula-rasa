Introduction:

The back-end/back-end server is the system that runs in the background and hosts all the components of a web application, it is the real system that runs all the processes and tasks that construct a web app.

A typical back-end consists of:

- **Web server**
- **Database**
- **Development framework**

We can also have more components on the back-end, like **hypervisors** (software/hardware/firmware that creates and runs VMs)**, containers** (an instance of VM) **and web application firewalls (WAFs)**. We usually have many different stacks that contain specific set of back end components, common examples are:

Hardware:

The back end server contains all the necessary hardware for a web app to run - the power and performance of this hardware determine how stable and fast the web app is.

For many architectures for huge web applications are designed to distribute load across many different servers and are designed to work together to complete tasks.

Web applications generally don't run on a single back-end server, but use data centres and cloud hosting services that provide virtual hosts for the web applications.
