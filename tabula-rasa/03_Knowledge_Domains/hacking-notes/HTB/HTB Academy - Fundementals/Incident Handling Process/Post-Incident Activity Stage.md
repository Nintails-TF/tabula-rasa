# Post Incident Activities:

Once an incident has been fully solved and remediated, our objective is to document the incident and improve our capabilities based on lessons learned from our previous mistakes and gaps.

This stage gives us an opportunity to reflect on the threat by understanding what occurred, what we did and how our actions and activities worked out. This information is best gathered and analysed in a meeting with all the stakeholders that were involved in the incident.

It generally takes place a few days after the incident, when the reporting has been finalised.

# Reporting:

The final report should address the whole incident handling process, a complete report often answers questions such as:

- What happened and when
	- We can think of this as a comprehensive and completed timeline.
- Performance of the team dealing with the incident in regard to plans, playbooks, policies and procedures.
- Did the business provide necessary information and promptly respond to aid in the handling of the incident in an efficient manner? What could be improved?
- What actions could of been implemented to contain and eradicate the incident?
- What preventative measures should be put in place to prevent similar incidents in the future?
- What tools and resources should be put in place to detect and analyse similar incidents in the future?

Such reports often provide us with measurable and useful results. For example, they can provide us with *how many incidents have been handled, how much time the team needs per incident, and the different actions that were performed during the handling process. It also provides reference for handling future events of a similar nature.*

In situations in which legal action needs to be taken, an incident report will also be used in court for identifying restitution and the impact of the incident.

Finally, this post-mortem is a great time to train new team members by showing them how the incident was handled by more experienced members. The team should also evaluate whether updating plans, playbooks, policies and procedures need updated. We can also look at if we need new tools, training for the team or company as a whole.
