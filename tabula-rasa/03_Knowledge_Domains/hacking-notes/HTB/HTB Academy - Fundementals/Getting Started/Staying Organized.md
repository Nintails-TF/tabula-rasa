Structure and Note Taking:

Since the field of infosec is so large and technical, it is important to have clear and accurate documentation in everything that is done from CTFs, Courses and wargames.

When attacking a target we should have a clear folder to save data to, like so:

![image1](../../../../_resources/image1-67.png)
(IPT stands for **Internal Penetration Test**, EPT stands for **External Penetration Test**).

As we can see we have subfolders for saving scan data, relevant tools, logging output, scoping information (Ips/networks/ports) and evidence of credentials and screenshots.

Basically what I have in OneNote is a good note system. As being a organised hacker is extremely important.
But it is important that if in a real world scenario that the notes are **NOT** synced to cloud.

*Learning Markdown can be helpful to write notes and easily represent data in an organised fashion. For a public writeup or report.*

(It could be useful to use tools like gitbook to create wiki type pages.)

Importance of a knowledge base:

Every expert in infosec should maintain and create a vast knowledge base. This knowledge base should contain quick reference guides to setup tasks that are performed on most assessments and cheat sheets for common commands.

As boxes, assessments, labs and courses are completed it is important to aggregate and collect every payload, command and tip. As you never know if they will come in handy later on.

It is also key to have templates for reports, checklists and building/finding a vulnerabilities database. This database can be in a spreadsheet or something more complex and will often include:

- Title
- Description
- Impact
- Remediation advice
- References

This is so critical as it allows hackers to save considerable time and effort during the reporting phase as the bulk of the findings will be written already and will only require a small amount of customization to the target environment.
