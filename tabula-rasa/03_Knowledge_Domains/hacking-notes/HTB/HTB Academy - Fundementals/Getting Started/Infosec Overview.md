**Information Security** (infosec) is a huge field and has grown and evolved in the past few years, it offers many jobs, specializations and salaries. These fields include:

- Network and Infrastructure security (Is a organisations network and hardware safe?)
- Application Security (Is my software safe?)
- Security testing (Do we have good security in place to stop bad actors?)
- Systems auditing (Are our systems configured correctly?)
- Business continuity planning (How do we deal with hacks/unplanned events?)
- Digital forensics (How do you de-obfuscate and decrypt data?)
- Incident detection and response (how do we detect hacks and deal with them?)

In essence what all of these fields and infosec as a whole tries to achieve is preventing unauthorized access, changes, unlawful usage, crime, etc of clients (Businesses, Governments, Military).

Data isn't always 1s and 0s, but also protecting intangible data (trade secrets and knowledge) from being siphoned. The CIA triad *protecting the confidentiality, integrity and availability of data* can summarise this well.

Risk Management:

Data Protection focusses on efficient policy without negatively affecting an organisation business operations and productivity. To achieve this, orgs must follow a risk management system.

The core tenant of infosec, maintaining CIA and making sure that data is not compromised.

Red Team VS Blue Team:

Red Teams refer to attackers (hackers, state actors, script kiddies, etc). They usually play an adversary role in breaking into orgs to identify any potential weaknesses real attackers that can use to break into systems.

Blue team refers to defenders (Security Researchers, system managers, etc). They make up the majority of jobs in the sphere of infosec. They strengthen the organizations defences by analysing risks, creating policies, responding to threats and using security tools.

Role of Penetration Testers:

A security assessor (Network pen tester, web app pen tester, red teamer, whatever you want to call it.) These risks may include network or web application vulnerabilities, sensitive data exposure, misconfiguration.
A good tester can work with a client to identify risks to their org and provide info on how to reproduce these risks and provide guidance on either mitigating or providing solutions to deal with issues during testing.

Many of the Penetration tests can include:

- White-box penetration against all in-scope systems and apps to find as many vulnerabilities as possible.
- Phishing and social engineering to test the employee's security awareness
- Targeted red team assessment built around a scenario to emulate a real-world threat actor.

Services like HTB are used to allow people to build hacking skills through exploiting vulnerable machines.
