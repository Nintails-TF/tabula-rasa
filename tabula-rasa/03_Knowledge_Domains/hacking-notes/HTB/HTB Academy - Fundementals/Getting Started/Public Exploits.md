Many tools can be used to help us find public exploits for various applications and services we can encounter during the enumeration phase. One way is googling the app name + *exploit*.

A well-known tool that is useful for this is **searchsploit** which allows us to search for a specific application by name and then it checks online databases for any exploits.

Practicing Metasploit:

Many HTB boxes allow you to practice Metasploit, these include:

As a caution, be careful to not overly rely on Metasploit. To be a well-rounded tester we must know how to use lots of different tools for the job and understand why they fail and what to try when Metasploit falters.

What is Metasploit?:

The Metasploit Framework (MSF) is an amazing tool for hackers, as it has many built in exploits for publicly known vulnerabilities and gives us an easy way to use them against exposed targets, MSF can also be used for:

- Running recon scripts to enumerate remote hosts and compromised targets
- Verification scripts to test the existence of a vulnerability without actually compromising the target
- Meterpreter, which helps connect to shells and run commands remotely.
- Many post-exploitation tools and pivoting tools.

To use MSF, simply type **msfconsole**, you can search for vulnerabilities using:

Would give a list of WordPress exploits. You then would copy the full name of the vulnerability. Along with the **use** keyword:

Before we run the exploit, we need to configure its options. Using the **show options** command. Then you would **set** the options to the target that you are interested in.

Importantly, we can use the **check** command to ensure that the server is vulnerable to our exploit.

Finally we would run our command.
