Metasploit Usage:

Now that we know that the server is running WordPress 5.6.1 with simple backup, we can use searchsploit for any exploits:

Using the simple backup vulnerability we can configure RHOSTS to the target ip:

Firstly, we need to figure out what is running on the server, Using techniques listed in [Web Enumeration](onenote:#Web Enumeration - Questions&section-id={F1C3EE68-95D4-4786-A8FE-FBD2DA77AF8E}&page-id={3C6F2275-8B7B-4E85-B496-C314A541B5AE}&end&base-path=E:\Hacking\Notes\writeUps\HTB%20Academy.one) we figure out the following:

- The server is running Apache 2.4.41 just like the last box.
- It is an EU HTTP server running Ubuntu Linux.
  - It also runs WordPress version 5.6.1, as whatweb informs us.
- We get the following URLs from GoBuster:

The includes area shows us the files that the website is using.
