Choosing a Distribution:

There are many Linux distros that you can use for pen testing; the main ones are kali and ParrotOS. With more advanced options like BlackArch. These are Debian based distros that contain many preloaded tools, not one distro has all of the tools, but most tools are rarely used.

In hacking we gravitate to the specific useful and powerful tools in almost every scenario, then more specific tools are used depending on the situation.

It is important to be able to perform each hack on a fresh VM. This is because it makes it easily replicable for clients and prevents holding onto client sensitive data for large amounts of time. For this reason, it is helpful to create scripts and automate creating a new VM for each assessment.

Setting up a Pentest Distro:

Pretty much every distro is ran using hypervisors on an existing OS. So we use software like VirtualBox or VMware to create and run VMs that share resources from the host machine. VMs run in isolation from primary operating systems, thus giving an extra layer of protection.

***A hypervisor is simply software that allows us to run virtual machines (VMs).***

(There are VM breakout hacks that occur from time to time though so it isn't a fool proof solution for security).

On a single system - depending on the amount of resources - we can run many VMs at once. Allowing us to recreate target applications and machines in a lab environment. A successful hacker must constantly hone their craft in order to beat criminals. Training by reproducing vulnerabilities at a home lab is a great way to improve.

It is common to build a lab on an old laptop, desktop or raspberry pi. However it is preferable to use a server to install a bare-metal hypervisor.

ISO vs OVA:

An ISO file is essentially a CD-ROM that can be mounted within a hypervisor, ISO gives us more room for customization. With keyboard layout, desktop environment switch and custom disk partitioning.

An OVA file is a pre-built application that is already configured with VM settings. These are easier to get up and running quicker.

ISO is good for personal practice and usage whilst an OVA is good for creating many VMs quickly.
