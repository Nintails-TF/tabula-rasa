We need to figure out how our brain is structured and how we can use it to learn better.

Frequently we have people who are very good at certain activities, but are bad at others. Take the computer nerd who is a wizard in the command line, but sucks at communicating with others.

The theory of thought:

We can declare a **thought** as:

*A thought is an individual process (action/reaction) to one our more influences (internal/external) in which information is interpreted and linked accordingly in our personal methodology.*

The brain works constantly to produce thoughts and our memory works via the association chains stored in our neurons in our brain.

Deciding what to do:

Before we decide to achieve a goal, we must become clear what we desire. We should
explain what we want and how it must feel to achieve said goal. This is the process of
**dreaming.**

Desire is very dependant in the belief in it, when we believe in our skills, we can subdue our fears and anxieties. ***Fear is a state and the product of our imagination of the future and its consequences where the present is suppressed.***

Getting better occurs via many failures and getting back up and practicing and trying different approaches.
