Skills and talents are developed over time and practice. Don't cope about not being **talented** enough, or get jealous about somebodies assumed natural skill or ability.

To get good at something you need to **constantly** confront yourself with situations and challenges to solve said problems, so having a mindset in which you are able to solve problems and confront them, will help you in many areas of work.

This enables us to expand our *skill repertoire* and *comfort zone* which enables us to think easier whilst under less pressure or confusion and tackle the problems at hand.

The development of skill is influenced via our thought patterns/processes and the activities we naturally gravitate to (video games, climbing, music, etc).
