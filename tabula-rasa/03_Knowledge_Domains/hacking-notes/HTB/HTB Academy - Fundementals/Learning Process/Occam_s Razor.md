What is it?

Occam's razor is a scientific theory that states: *The most straightforward theory is always the most probable.* This means that if our PC isn't working - it is unlikely that North Korea injected malware into it and fried the hardware, it is more likely that you have a faulty wire or connection.

We can use this to gradually work through the most straightforward issues (turning it off and on again) and eliminate the simple possibilities.

Try to not box yourself in with the wording of your problem, If you have an issue with your PC and think:

*Why is my PC not getting power?*

You may first think about your **power supply** because you have limited your sight on just your conceptions about power.

How do we use this in hacking?:

You should focus on the **concept** when learning about a subject. You will get the processes
Over time and with practice.

The simplest explanation for hacking is to:
***Work with the information we can get.***

So you should learn the whole picture in attacking a system/box. Not the steps or the code needed to execute the issue. But how to enumerate, find a foothold and raise your privileges.
