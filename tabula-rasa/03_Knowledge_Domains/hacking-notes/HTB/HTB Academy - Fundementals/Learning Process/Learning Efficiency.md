How to Learn:

The primary objective we need to overcome is the **combination** of our knowledge, adaptation and new information. So to find out the information we need, we need to know:

- *What do we already know?*
- *What do we not know yet?*

Even if we find the info we need, we may not know how to use it. Another major problem is handling the sheer amount of info and adapting it to our strengths and weaknesses.

The purpose of the academy:

The point of HTB academy is to act as a **guided instructor** into learning. You see what can happen, how to practical do something and how to improve existing skills. Then you go off into other avenues like attacking boxes/CTFs/wargames and practically use and sharpen your skillset.

What does it mean to be "good"?:

Since companies and businesses want to hire, "good" penetration testers and information security specialists, we need to understand what being "good means.

To be good, we need to **know what we are doing**. To do this we need to be experienced with a topic, experience means we have a vast **repertoire** of skills in a field. To build this repertoire we need to **associate** and have **practical experience** with the time at hand.

We need to become competent at a specific task. It is said that it takes 10,000 hours to become an expert. We don't want to spend 10,000 hours learning a skill.
Learning efficiently:

We can learn something new in 20 hours, even just working on something for 45mins
per day. You can also think about the **Pareto Principle** (80:20 rule). In which with 20% of the effort, we can get 80% of the result.

We can become excellent fast, the **learning curve**, with **active and passive learning** and using the **Learning Pyramid.**

Retention Rates - Learning Pyramid:

- 90% - Teach a concept to someone.
- 75% - Practice what you have learned.
- 50% - Engage in a group discussion.
- 30% - Watch a demonstration.
- 20% - Watch a video.
- 10% - Read a book.
- 5% - Listen to a lecture.

Break down a skill into its components
Around 3-5 resources is ideal - learn enough so you know that you are making a mistake.
Remove barriers to practice  
Practice for at least 20 hours.
