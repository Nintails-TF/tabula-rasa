You can't learn it all:

Infosec is massive, you cannot learn everything. Nobody wants to spend years grinding away at technical intricacies of programming languages, but all programming languages follow 3 basic tenants:

1.  Principle of Abstraction.
2.  Principle of Correspondence.
3.  Principle of Data type completeness.

In a similar vein, as we begin to understand more about technology, we begin to understand the core tenants behind all technology. When hacking, we won't always know how something works, this is good as it gives us time to learn and grow.

Assessing our knowledge:

When we interact with others in the infosec sphere, we generally find two types of people:
1.  People who don't know anything.
2.  People who **think** they don't know anything.

It is hard to know our actual skill and knowledge level, pen testers need to have deep knowledge of lots of technologies and since there is so much info available, we can learn lots about every topic and not master a single area or we can master a single area and be an expert.

The only way you can be a good hacker is via **practically breaking into machines and systems.** Passive learning via books is good and all, but when we need to write our own programs or sort out real world problems - there is no substitute.

Learning how to learn:

A common question is:

*When is a penetration tester good enough?*

We know that a single person cannot know everything. We need to learn how to **find, choose, adapt and learn** the information we need.

*There isn't just one solution to a problem, but tons of different ways to succeed.*

**I would add that being able to explain technical aspects to non-technical people is a critical skill in marketing yourself and verbalising that you know your stuff.**
