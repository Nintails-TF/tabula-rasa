Thinking outside the box:

Why did I not think outside the box?:

My brain first went to the maths I did in high school and tried to do something similar what I learned there, my brain tried to use past experience to make the problem easier and require less mental energy.

I also didn't think about the problem for a really long time, I just came up with a snap solution and moved on quickly to the next area of learning.

I suppose that also the structure of learning and general law and society makes you think in a regimented way. Do what the system has told you to do and don't deviate or you'll get punished. Either by the law or by people who don't understand or respect what you are doing.

Think about how great geniuses who have influenced the world get burned, poisoned, chucked in jail, stoned etc. Since they "thought outside the box" and people didn't like their idea or were fearful/angry/emotional about it.

Thinking outside the box comes with the risk in that what you come up with may not be acceptable to the social norms and ideologies

When solving this problem:

I decided to divide by 20, then divide by 2 and add them to the number. This solves the equation.

There wasn't any constraints so I never thought about adding more digits or to replace the arithmetic operations.
