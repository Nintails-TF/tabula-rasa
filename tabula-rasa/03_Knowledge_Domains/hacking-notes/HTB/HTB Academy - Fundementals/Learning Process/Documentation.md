The purpose of documentation, is to make sure that there is:

1.  A clear overview
2.  Structure
3.  Clarity

As we learn and practice, we need to process a huge amount of information.

When we write documentation, we need to think about who the documentation is for and how to tailor it to the user. Regardless of this, there are a few good guidelines to follow:

- Put yourself in the shoes of a layman, make sure they can understand it
- Avoid repetition and ambiguity
- Make documentation easy to read.
