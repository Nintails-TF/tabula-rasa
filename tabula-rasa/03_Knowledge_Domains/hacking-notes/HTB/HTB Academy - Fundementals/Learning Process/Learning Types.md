Active Learning:

This means when we are learning we should try to practically do activities once we build up our knowledge. This means we need to **be an active learner.**

Information has a certain level of **quality**, we need a **repertoire** which will collect by **practicing.** Therefore, it is essential to understand the context of the topic we are researching.

It depends on our **motivation, focus** and **our goal.**

Finding Success:

There are many ways to stay motivated. An excellent method that works well is via recognising success. Even the most minor successes. We must recognise our successes and see that we have made progress.

We already know that it is important to have a goal. If we are focusses on our goal, we will notice when we drift from our path.

By following our path, we automatically look back to see how far we have come. At this point we should notice the **progress** we have made.

**Progress is noticeable when the question/problem that tortured us has lost meaning.**

Avoiding overloading:

If we try to learn too much at once, we will burnout. So we should make sure to take frequent breaks. So how many breaks should we have? - it is important to decide this on our own.

What happens when we are stuck? There are many different ways to become stuck.

- If we are tired, then we can take a break.
- If we focus too much, then we can take a step back and re-evaluate the problem.

It is important to train the eye to notice small details.

How to think creatively:

There are a couple features of creative thinking:

1.  Analysis - before you creatively think about something, you need to think about it and understand it.
2.  Open-mindedness - You should also be able to set aside any biases or assumptions from past experiences, thus giving yourself a chance to consider new ideas.

Take an existing idea or project and give it the **three ifs**. I.e. if you wanted to build a website, then answer these questions

1.  What if you had more money.
2.  What if you had more time.
3.  What if you had a team to work on this.
So on and so forth.
