Setting Goals:

A goal is defined and the desired endpoint of a process, i.e. The **goal** of me working through HTB courses is learn how to hack and get an OSCP.

There are many different types of goals:
- Quantitative goals
- Qualitative goals
- Complementary goals
- Competing goals
- Indifferent goals
- Main goals
- Secondary goals

For every goal, there are different *formulas, models, advice* that have been created to achieve goals in the **best way possible** or in the **shortest time** possible.

Depending on a goal, we take different paths that suit us. If the goal Is just to get a certification, we will take the path of least resistance, rather than trying to full master all content we will use our skills to make each task as easy as possible.

We need to think on our own about how to approach each goal and deal with problems, this allows us to learn and build up our knowledge and information in our brain.
Importance of goals:

Since the decision of what goal we want to achieve influences how we learn and perform a task or a goal can change how we think.

You can also look at celebrities and athletes and they never thought things were going to turn out the way they are now. They had a goal, but didn't have a map (a step by step path) to get there.

No matter what goal we have, we should decide on it.
