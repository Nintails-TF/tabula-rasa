Importance of emotions:

In our progress as a hacker, we need to be able to *think outside the box* and pivot to new ideas/methods/techniques if things aren't working. Since we need to focus on so many things at once, this can become **frustrating** or **confusing.** Remember that:

*A problem is just an emotional state, without emotions it becomes a situation.*

In other words, it is important to have a good emotional state in order to learn. If we are confident, we know we can reach our goal, we will be successful.

Know your goal:

Imagine the following scene:

Changing this slightly:

So, the big difference is that since you **know your goal** you can move on and achieve the goal, rather than being disorientated.

What is my goal?:

I want to get a job in cybersecurity because it pays well and is interesting to learn about. I want to do something that involves hacking - breaking systems and figuring out what I can exploit.

I want to do bug bounties and get paid from them, since I enjoy the idea of working and learning only as and when you need to, rather than going into a job and working for a set amount of hours.

This means that I would benefit from going down a bug bounty path, or a penetration tester route or anything to do with red teaming.
