Bug bounty program structure:

A bug bounty program normally consists of a few different elements:
- **Vendor Response SLAs**
  - How the vendor will contact you
- **Access**
  - Defines how to create or obtain accounts for research purposes.
- **Eligibility Criteria**
  - Defines what you need to do to get a bounty, normally being the first report sent in.
- **Responsible Disclosure Policy**
  - Defines disclosure timelines, coordination actions to disclose a vulnerability safely.
- **Rules of Engagement**
  - What you are and aren't allowed to do in the program.
- **Scope**
  - The IP ranges and stuff that you can hack on.
  - Very important to not be out of scope.
- **Report Format**
- **Rewards**
- **Safe Harbour**
- **Legal terms and conditions**
- **Contact info.**

Conclusion:

- *You should be **extremely** meticulous when looking at a bug bounty program. Make sure you follow the code of conduct and avoid breaking any rules.*
  - *This just avoids lots of headache and wasted time.*

Introduction:

Bug bounties are more than an engine for receiving recognition and cash for discovering and documenting bugs. A bug bounty program (VRP - Vulnerability Rewards Program) is continuous and proactive security testing that supplements internal code audits and penetration tests

*"Continuous testing, constant protection."*

Bug Bounty Program Types:

Bug bounty programs are either public or private:

- **Private VRPs -** These aren't public and bug bounty hunters can only participate if approved/invited by the company/organisation.
  - Many bug bounty systems start off as private, then transition to being public after getting the hang of receiving and triaging vulnerability reports.
    - As a consequence of this, there is going to be some more low hanging fruit and some extra opportunities for being the "first man on the scene".
  - You get invites, by having a good track records, writing good reports and finding valid bugs.
    - If security is tight, private bug bounties may require a background check.
- **Public VRPs** - These are public programs that allow anyone to submit reports.
- **VDPs** - Vulnerability disclosure programs are how you can report security vulnerabilities.
  - They are the "see something, say something" of the internet.

Code of Conduct:

It is **very important** that you understand the code of conduct of the bug bounty program or bug bounty platform that you are working in, this is because violations and strikes are kept for a long time (12 months). So you need to avoid getting reprimanded by admins, as you'll lose access to some juicer programs.
