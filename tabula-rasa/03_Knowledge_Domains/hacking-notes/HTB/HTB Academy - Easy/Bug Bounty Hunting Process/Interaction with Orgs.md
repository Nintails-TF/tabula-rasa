Introduction:

After you have submitted a bug report, you should generally give the security/triage team, some time to process your report. You can look at the vendor response times or response efficiency metrics to get an idea on how long it will take.

If the security/triage team doesn't get back to you in decent time, you then should contact **mediation.**

Once someone replies to you, remember there tag, as they will be dealing with your submission. Don't reach out to them on social media or anything like that.

Remain calm and professional when communicating with the triage/security team.

Dealing with disagreements:

The security team may disagree with the severity of the bug and reduce your bounty. In the case of this, proceed as followed:

1.  Explain your reasoning behind why you chose this severity score and guide the team through each metric value you specified in the CVSS calculator. Eventually you will reach an agreement.
2.  Go over the bug bounty policy and scope and ensure that your submission complies with both. Also make sure that the bounty amount resembles the policy of the bug bounty program.
3.  If none of this was fruitful, contact mediation.
