*Introduction:*
- *At first you'll be limited to public programs, you can mitigate this by doing the hacker101 CTF. Eventually you get to a point in which you get spammed by invites to private programs.*
  - *Just keep hacking and learning and you can get private invites.*
- *Choose a **responsive program**, that has a **limited scope** and **bugs you can look for**.*
- *Play to your strengths.*

***What should you look for?***

- *Friendly and responsive team.*
- *Large enough scope to pivot*
  - *Skip to another app/area. One app can tell you about another app.*
- *A scope that isn't completely interconnected.*
  - *This helps you to avoid going out of scope.*
- *A team that is interested in your bugs + generate impact*
  - *More impact = more money.*
- *An interesting attack surface.*

*You decide:*
- *Assets/Bugs that play to your strengths*
- *Public or private.*
- *Low average bounty, means that there is more low hanging fruits.*

***What is in scope?:***
- *Domains: Website or web apps*
- *Other*
  - *Recon/google dorking*
- *Android/iOS*
  - *A mobile app.*
- *Source Code*
  - *Looking at code*
- *Hardware*

***Scope Size:***
- *Large scope means that there is more stuff to hack, this also means there are lots of low hanging bugs.*
  - *Your first bug is not-going to be too technical.*
  - *It can improve your recon.*
- *Smaller scope means that there is less stuff to hack, but it is sometimes **ignored**.*
  - *Smaller scope is more understandable, but it can be overlooked.*

***Code Review VS Applications:***
- *Code reviews are good if you are a developer and help you contribute to Open Source.*
  - *There is also less competition.*
- *Applications are more successful for newbies.*
- *Bugs can appear that aren't noticeable in code.*
- *You can be fluid between both.*

***Mobile vs Web:***
- *Mobile has less competition, but requires more setup with emulators and configuration.*
- *Web has more competition, but has more bugs and is more accessible.*

**Bugs Types and Impact:**
- *Technical Bugs:*
  - *CSRF*
  - *SSRF*
  - *XSS*
  - *RCE*
- *Non-technical Bugs:*
  - *IDORs*
  - *Information disclosure*
  - *Business Logic Errors*

*It's worth looking at the attack surface of your target and what the bugs that have the most impact with the software possible.*

*If you have technical skills look at technical bugs, Otherwise you can start to look at non-technical bugs.*

***Public vs Private Programs:***
- *It doesn't matter too much - you can argue either way that each one of easier.*
- *An advantage of a public program, is that you get to see what the team is like to work with.*
  - *You can dodge them if they are assholes, or work with them more if they are kind.*

***Working with a team:***
*Importantly, you should look at:*
- *Average bounty range*
  - *Compare this to the bounty table to get an idea of what kinds of bugs are submitted.*
  - *Lots of low numbers, means that lots of low hanging fruits has been picked up.*
- *Reports received/resolved*
  - *Newer programs might have more bugs.*
- *Last report resolved*
  - *How active the program is.*

***Disclosures:***
*Disclosure gives insight on how nice it is to work with a team. If the team is understanding and professional then they are great for noobs. (Especially if they are detailed when asking for info.)*

*If the team is hostile or are clueless, you don't want to get involved with them as a noob.*
