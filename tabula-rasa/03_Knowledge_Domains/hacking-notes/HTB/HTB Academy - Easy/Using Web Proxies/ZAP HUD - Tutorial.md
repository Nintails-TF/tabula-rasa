**FIXING ZAP HUD -**

*If ZAP hud breaks, you can close the integrated browser and then reopen it.*

**Enabling the HUD:**

1.  Click on the sonar icon in the toolbar and load a website in the integrated browser.

**HTTPS Upgrade:**

ZAP hud uses a custom zap domain to communicate with the zap proxy, this **only works on HTTPS.** This means that all HTTP is redirected as HTTPS internally, then when the request is forwarded, it is HTTP.

**Hiding the HUD:**
Sometimes we want to hide the ZAP hud to avoid covering up key details.

1.  Click the green symbol on the bottom right corner.

**ZAP Alerts:**

Zap reports on potential security error using **alerts,** these alerts can be raised by any ZAP component - but are frequently raised by:

1.  *Passive Scanning*
    1.  *ZAP will scan all the requests that are proxied through it or are generated by spidering. Passive scanning involves just looking at raw requests and responses, so nothing gets changed at it is safe.*
2.  *Active Scanning*
    1.  *Active scanning attempts to find other vulnerabilities by using known attacks against the selected target(s). Active scanning is a real attack and can degrade services and trip IDS/WAFs. So be careful when doing this*

**Alert Notifications:**

When ZAP finds an issue it will be displayed in the bottom right corner - this will only be displayed the first time a specific alert is discovered.

You can click on them to get details about them. These alerts are stored

**Enable Fields:**

We can click on the **Show/Enable** tool (the lightbulb) to enable disabled fields - this is useful since developers may not think that users can access these fields.

**Show/Enable** can also be used to reveal hidden fields - The lightbulb will have a number next to it which denotes how many hidden fields there are

**Break:**

The break tool is used to change requests **on the fly.** When we enable this tool on the left side of the HUD, ALL requests from the browser will be intercepted by ZAP. This means if we accept a form, we can modify the request before it reaches the web server.

**Resend:**

This feature enables you to both **repeat** and **change** requests that have been sent to your browser or ZAP. This applies to ALL requests you see in your HUD - via the site tree or history tab. You can resend in two ways:

*Resend in console -* This will submit the request - along with changes - and show the response in the response tab. This allows us to change the request and see the details in raw HTML.

*Resend in browser -* This will submit the request with changes and show changes in the browser, this works with both POST and GET requests.

**Active Scan:**

The active scan will try to find vulnerabilities by using known attack vectors against the current site, it will only scan websites that are in scope. We can start an active scan by click on the fire icon on the right of the HUD

Once an active scan is started, the fire will turn orange. And it will show its progress and raise alerts if it finds anything.

We only really want to run this once we have mapped out the websites well.

**Attack mode:**

This crosshair icon that can be accessed at the right of the hud will do the same scans as the active scanner but it will scan any URLs that are in scope as they are added to scope.

We usually want to enable this whilst we are exploring a website.

**Comments:**

The comments tool shows all HTML comments on the page - currently JS comments or subframe comments are not implemented. You will see a **red exclamation mark** if any suspicious string are detected.

The suspicious strings are:
![image4](../../../../_resources/image4-82.png)

The comments tool when clicked will show text bubble icons where comments are located. You can do the same thing by viewing source, but comments are quicker.

Showing comments can also break sites and is tab specific.

**HTML Report:**

The HTML report plugin gives you a quick report on all potential security issues, by clicking on the book icon you can see a report.
**Page Alerts:**

Potential security issues are shown by page alerts, this enables us to focus on the current page, each alert has an associated risk:
![image5](../../../../_resources/image5-63.png)

We can view these alerts in the ZAP Alerts Tab:
![image6](../../../../_resources/image6-42.png)

**Site Alerts:**

Site alerts are displayed to any of the pages that you visit and you can see them on the right side hud. This include all alerts on the other pages too. The risk is the same as page alerts.

**History:**

The history tab is at the bottom of every page and it shows all request we have made since we have opened the page. These can be requests for images or JavaScript files or even API requests.

If new pages are requests even after the page has loaded, it is probably an API requests. We can see this in the ZAP main history tab too:
![image7](../../../../_resources/image7-36.png)

**Web Sockets:**

This tab is next to the history tab and shows all WebSocket requests that have been made by your browser. If a message is sent or received after the page loads, then this tab will show a count of these messages.

WebSocket messages can be in either text or binary - you can modify any text web socket requests, but not any binary messages (yet).

**Sites:**

ZAP builds up a hierarchical site tree based on the URLs that the browser accesses. This is recorded on the site tool (the globe) on the right of the hud, you can also click on any URLs to see the request and response code.

**Scope:**

The scope tool (the target) enables you to check if a page that you are on is "in scope" or not. When you start using the HUD, no pages will be in scope and the target is grey. **When you add a target to scope, then the target will be red.**

This makes it easy to check if you are in scope or not.

You can also right click in the main window and **add to context** to add a URL to scope.

**Spider:**

ZAP has two spidering tools, the regular spider which crawls all the web pages and follows all the links, it is fast, but cannot follow links defined using JavaScript.

You can start the spider tool - but this tool will only spider websites in scope - but you can use it to add websites to scope.

The spider will be fast on small websites, but can take a long time on large websites.

**Ajax Spider:**

This is the red spider, This spider is much slower than the regular spidering tool, but it can handle JavaScript links.

You generally want to run the AJAX spider in headless mode, as to not have random browser windows pop-up, but if you need to debug the spider, you can launch it in non-headless version to see what is going on.

It also raises alerts as it scans URLs like the regular spider.

**Tool Configuration:**

We can add new tools by clicking on the + symobls, we can also remove tools by right-clicking on the icons - you can do this to reorder tools to your wishing.

**Toggle Script:**

ZAP scripts are very powerful and can be used to: **perform custom scans, generate alerts, fuzz and build payloads.**

The toggle scripts icon (a sheet of paper) enables you to toggle scripts on or off, you will get a selection of scripts to toggle:
![image8](../../../../_resources/image8-31.png)

**HUD Customisation:**

Finally by clicking the gear icon, you can:
1.  Reset HUD to default
2.  Take HUD tutorial
3.  Show HUD changelog

If a change has been made since you last looked at the options, they will have a red exclamation mark.
