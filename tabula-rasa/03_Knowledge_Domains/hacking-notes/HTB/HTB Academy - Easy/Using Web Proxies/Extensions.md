Introduction:

Both BURP and ZAP have extension marketplaces in which you can install plugins created by other users, from tool that beautify code, adding new wordlists or even creating and adding new tools.

Bapp Store:

This is burp's extension store, we can sort by popularity or by rating to get reputable plugins:

(Note that there are plugins that only work with the pro license.)

If we were to install **decoder improved** we would gain a new tab that has the ability to decode more forms of encoding:

Extensions worth checking out are the following:

ZAP marketplace:

The ZAP marketplace is similar to the Bapp store in burp, we click manage add-ons to add new plugins:
![image4](../../../../_resources/image4-90.png)

In this tab we can see different ZAP add-ons, some add-ons are in the **alpha, beta or release builds.** Which means depending on what you install, you can expect some issues or bugs.

We can try using **FuzzDB Files** and **FuzzDB Offensive:**

These plugins will add more wordlists when we are **file fuzzing**. These various add-ons can simplify the process of pentesting and can offload the heavy lifting to a program.

Conclusion:

**Web proxies** are essential tools for web pen-testers, they are a must have in the toolbox along with Nmap, Hashcat, Wireshark, tcpdump, sqlmap, ffuf and GoBuster.
