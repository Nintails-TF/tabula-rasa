Overview:

WordPress is one of the most popular **Content Management Systems (CMS) -** it powers almost a third of all websites in the world. It is used for hosting blogs, forums, e-commerce stores and much more. Wordpress is also highly customisable and is good for SEO (Search Engine Optimisation) making it popular with big companies and startups.

Wordpress has a large library of extensions in the form of **themes and plugins** examples of this are **WPForums** - a robust contact form, **Monster Insights** which can be used to access Google Analytics and **Constant Contact** a popular email marketing service.

However, in this flexibility there is danger - as many themes and plugins are vulnerable to attack.

Wordpress usually runs on an **Apache** webserver with a **MySQL** DB as a backend. Many companies offer Wordpress as an option when creating a new website and even assist with backend tasks like security updates.

What is a CMS?:

A CMS is a powerful tool that helps create a website without the need to program everything from scratch, in some case - no programming is required at all. A CMS does the heavy lifting of the infrastructure and enables developers to focus on the design of the website.

Lots of CMS's allow users to drag and drop and to edit a website like a word document - users can also upload media directly to the CMS rather than needing to interact with a web-server via FTP or SFTP.

A CMS has two main components:

1.  **A Content Management Application (CMA)**
    1.  *This is the interface used to add an manage content.*
2.  **A Content Delivery Application (CDA)**
    1.  *This is the backend that takes the input entered into the CMA and assembles it into a working and nice looking website.*

You can think of CMA as the GUI and the CDA as the commands occurring in the background.

A good CMS should allow users to add functionality and design elements to a website without needing to work with the code and user management tools to give users specific access to content (unregistered user, normal user, admin, etc). We also want to be able to update and upload files easily and proper **version control** (tracking and managing changes to the website).

Finally we want a CMS that is well-maintained and has sufficient security to harden the website from attackers.
