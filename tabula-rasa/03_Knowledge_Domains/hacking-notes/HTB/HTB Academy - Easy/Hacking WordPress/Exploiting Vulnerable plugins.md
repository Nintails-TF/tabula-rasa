Leveraging WPScan results:

Now that we have a report from WPScan we realise that there are a ton of vulnerabilities, mainly:

- The website uses an old version of WordPress (5.3.2).
- An outdated theme (Twenty Twenty).
- Three vulnerable plugins
  - Mail-masta (1.0)
  - Photo-gallery (1.5.3)
  - Google-review-slider (6.1)

**Mail-masta** is going to be our target here and we can use a **LFI (Local File Inclusion)** exploit to read local files.

Exploiting the LFI:

We can access the password folder via navigation to it (<https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/40290>), we have the proof of concept so we can easily access the folder:

\[server name\]/wp-content/plugins/mail-masta/inc/campaign/count_of_send.php?pl=/etc/passwd
![image1](../../../../_resources/image1-131.png)

Thus we can get the passwords from the webserver.
Exploiting the LFI using cURL:

Instead of using the browser we can get the result in cURL:
![image2](../../../../_resources/image2-107.png)

The formatting from cURL makes it so much easier to see.
