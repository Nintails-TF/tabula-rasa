# Introduction:

Fingerprinting involves extracting information about the technological back-end of a website or web app - just like how fingerprinting is used to identify people, we can build up a unique signature of the *web servers, operations systems and software components* that can reveal key info about the infrastructure of a target and any potential security flaws.

This enables us to tailor our attack to the system that we are interested in.

Fingerprinting serves as a important tool in the arsenal of web reconnaissance, for a few reasons:

- **Targeted Attacks**
	- *By knowing what kinds of technologies which are being used, attackers can focus efforts on exploits and vulnerabilities which are likely to work. Increasing the chances of compromise.*
- **Identifying Misconfigurations**
	- *Fingerprinting enables us to spot any misconfigured or outdated software, default credentials, or other critical weaknesses.*
- **Prioritising Targets**
	- *Fingerprinting helps us as attackers figure out where the high-value or vulnerable sections of a system are.*
- **Building up a comprehensive profile**
	- *Combining fingerprinting with other reconnaissance activities enables us to get a more detailed and holistic view of the target's infrastructure - which enables us to have a better security posture and highlights more potential attack vectors.*
