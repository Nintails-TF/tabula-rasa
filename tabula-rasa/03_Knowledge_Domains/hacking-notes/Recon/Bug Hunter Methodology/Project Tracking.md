Ultimately you will need to write down notes about the project you are working on, be it:

- Site-hierarchy
- Tools output
- Interesting Notes

You can use a tool like **Xmind** to create mind maps about the project. And basically any text editor can work for report writing and recording tools. Mind maps allow for visualisation of larger scopes and allow you to break down and take a deep dive into smaller chunks of a project.

One note is actually used by some other professionals!

Wide Recon:

Wide recon means to discover as many assets as possible related to the target (just be sure that your scope allows you to test these vectors!). For example:

- Scope Domains
- Acquisitions
- ASN enumeration
- Reverse WHOIS
- Subdomain Enumeration
- Port Analysis

It can be a good idea to start thinking about automation in respect to these tools, so that you can make your own tools and scripts to help you save time
