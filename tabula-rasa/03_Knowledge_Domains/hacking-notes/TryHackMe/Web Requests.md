BookFace (Instagram Bug):

You can brute force web requests, for example in this case. Once you get a username from the address bar, you are able to send a password reset request.

Since this password reset request was a 4 digit numeric code, this could be brute forced by sending web requests that incremented by 1 each time. Allowing you to get access to any users account.
