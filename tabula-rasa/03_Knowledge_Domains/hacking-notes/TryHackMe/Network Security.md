## Target 110m Credit Card Hack:

In 2013 target got hacked with attackers stealing over 110 million credit cards from users by exploiting an air conditioning unit.

This was because the air conditioners were controlled remotely and were smart conditioners that had built in computers.

These units were on the same network as checkout tills and allowed hackers to steal credit card details.

These aircon units needed to be **segmented** from the network, but since the units were owned by a 3rd party to help monitor the stores temperature, security had been lax from this 3rd party.

Target suffered \$300 million in data breach lawsuits because of this. Target was using powerful malware detection used by the FBI and CIA, but attackers disguised their traffic as legitimate computer network traffic.
