# Target

**Endgame:** To play chess at my own level, as Capablanca would.


## Endgame Target Winrate:
```
	- 98-100% King and pawn endgames.
	- 80% (Complex) 90% (Basic) Rook + Pawn vs Rook
	- Q+P vs Q: 85%
	- Rook vs Minor piece 88%
		- R+P vs B 90%
		- R+P vs N 85%
		- R vs B+2P 85%
	- Bishop Endgames 92%
		- Same coloured 95%
		- Opposite coloured 90%
	- Knight endgames 88%
		- Knight + N+P 85%
		- Knight Vs Pawns 90%
```

Must be able to explain these to beginners or at least intermediate players for the more complex endgames.

## Checkmates:
```
- Q+K vs K (100% in 10 moves)
- R+K vs K (100% in 16 moves)
- 2B+K vs K (95%)
- B+N+K vs K (85%)
```
