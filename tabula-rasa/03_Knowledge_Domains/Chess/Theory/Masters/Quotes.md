# Quotes:

*"When you sit down to play a game you should think only about the position, but not about the opponent. Whether chess is regarded as a science, or an art, or a sport, all the same psychology bears no relation to it and only stands in the way of real chess."* ~ Jose Raul Capablanca

*"You can't learn if you don't remember in the first place."* - Ben Finegold

*My job as a chess player is not to win games, but it is simply to place my pieces where they are happy and to create harmony on the board.*
