# French Defence:

## Core Ideas:

Black will generally attack on the queenside, as his pawns face there, whilst white will attack on the kingside. This isn't always true, but a general rule of thumb.

Secondly, black wants to find a way to break up the position and undermine white's central pawns. This can be done via the c-pawn break (common) or the f-pawn break (rare). The c-pawn break is preferable, as you strike at the base of the pawn chain, and your king is better protected.

White usually wants to develop an attack on the kingside, meaning white will come out and attack strongly, whilst Black will manoeuvre pieces to stop white and prevent/limit any advantage.
### Pros:

The French is a solid opening choice as it sidesteps aggressive openings that strike at the f-pawn, as you cover it up right away. Preventing bishops openings, fried livers, gambit lines, etc.

The main ideas are based around understanding, correct plans, and positional play. 

The theory is of a medium difficulty, not as in-depth as something like a Sicilian repertoire, but a bit more tricky than the Caro-Kann.

### Cons:

You have a "bad" light-squared bishop. Which is difficult to develop due to your pawn on e6. It only really controls one square and it is a challenge to develop it.

It isn't a very testing opening, in the sense that you are relying on your opponent to blunder or make mistakes, otherwise the French can be quiet drawish, but this can honestly be a benefit in certain situations as well.

***
# (Paulsen) Normal Variation (3. Nc3):

This is the most popular variation in the position, you have various sub lines that you can go into depending on what you want as the black pieces.

## 3. Bb4 Winawer:

The Winawer is the most popular response for Black. The idea is to pin the knight to the king early and strike in the centre with c5. This is because Nc3 stops white from c3.

`5. a3 Bxc3+` - a3 forces black to capture the knight
`6. bxc3 (Ne7/Nc6)` - White gains control of the centre for the cost of doubled c-pawns. Black then continues development.

### 7. Qg4 Poisoned Pawn Variation:

Black can either choose to defend the the g-pawn with `7. O-O` (Old main line), or sacrifice his pawn with `7. Qc7` (Most popular nowadays). Stockfish says that both ideas are about equal, around +0.60.

### 7. Qc7 Main Line:

Black sacrifices both his g and h pawns with `8. Qxg7 Rg8 9. Qxh7 cxd4` this creates a potential fork on the king and rook that must be addressed with `10. Ne2`. 

Black then has the choice to recapture right away `10. dxc3` if white recaptures, they lose the game or continue development with tempo `10. Nbc6`.

### 7. O-O Old Variation:

White will quickly develop his bishop `8. Bd3` to start a kingside attack, Black has two main responses of:

- `8. Nbc6` White has a few normal and one dangerous reply, with `9. Nf3`, `9. Qh5` life goes on as black has the defensive resources of `9. Ng6` or `9. f5` 
	- `9. Bg5` is very tough for black. Stockfish rates +1, and the only real response is `9. Qa5`
- `8. f5` This response is generally superior for black, as when white takes with en-passant `9. rxf6` works, where as in the knight line, since the bishop can already be in position, then f5 becomes losing.

# 3. Nf6 Classical:

This is the initial way black played in the French defence, it is the 2nd most popular choice and it is a strong way of playing the position.

## 4. Bg5 Classical Variation:

If white goes for the immediate pin on the knight, Black has a few options:

- `4. dxe4` - Burn Variation
	- Best for simplified positions
- `4. Be7` - Normal Variation
	- Typical French manoeuvring plans
- `4. Bb4` - MacCutcheon Variation
	- Sharp tactical battle

### Burn Variation:

Classical Defence
Morozevich Line 
### Normal Variation:

Steinitz Variation
Alekhine-Chatard Attack
### MacCutcheon Variation:

Lasker Variation
Janowski Variation

## 4. Steinitz Variation:

## 3. Dxe4 Rubenstein:

***

## Tarrasch Variation (3. Nd2):

You have a few ideas that you can play when against the Tarrasch. The top 3 being:

1. Closed Variation (Nf6 -> e5)
	1. The goal is to undermine the centre with c5, the timing is critical with this pawn break, if you miss the timing, you'll end up worse.
	2. Nc6 keeping tension is strong, slightly better than cxd4.
	3. Qb6 is always solid in the French structure.
	4. Be7 prepares castling
	5. O-O, etc.
2. Open Variation
	1. a
3. Rubenstein Variation
	1. a

***
## Advanced Variation (3. e5):

The advanced option, means it is difficult for you to develop your pieces. Then plan becomes to **remove and strike at these centre-pawns** so that you can develop your pieces fully.

c5 undermining the centre is a strong idea. As it directly challenges white and achieves our goal. White should not take as it weakens his structure and speeds up development from black. The e pawn is isolated and black can develop his bishop with Bxc5.

Igor suggests Bd7 (Euwe Variation). A tricky move that can punish mindless development of Bb5, with Nxe5! Winning a centre pawn.

A key idea for white is to develop his bishop to d3, aiming at your kingside and loading up ammo for an eventual attack. Rc8 has ideas of punishing this, you can trade in the centre then play Nb4, with ideas of trading down your knight for bishop. Nc2 forks are totally possible.

If you can remove the light bishop you'll have a comfortable game with ideas of:
- Ne7 - You want to rout the knight to the juicy f5 square to defend your king and attack the centre.
- h6 - You want to kick the bishop to Bh4, so that your Nf5 backs a greater punch.
- Qb6 - If your opponent persist with the pin, this is a good option as it can aim at the centre and weak b-pawns.
	- This move is a common motif in the French.

g5!? is a crazy move, which if you understand the theory, you can create madness on the board.

***
## Exchange Variation (3. exd5):

This is the most dry and drawish variation. Your main idea as black is to complete kingside development and get castled. The following moves are ideal:

- Nf6
- Bd6
- O-O

Really it is just natural development.
