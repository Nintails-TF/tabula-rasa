# French Defence:

## Core Ideas:
### Pros:

The French is a solid opening choice as it sidesteps aggressive openings that strike at the f-pawn, as you cover it up right away. Preventing bishops openings, fried livers, gambit lines, etc.

The main ideas are based around understanding, correct plans, and positional play. Which is ideal for a developing player, as it isn't theory dense.

### Cons:

You have a "bad" light-squared bishop. Which is difficult to develop due to your pawn on e6.



### Normal Variation (3. Nc3):
### Exchange Variation (3. exd5):

This is the most dry and drawish variation. Your main idea as black is to complete kingside development and get castled. The following moves are ideal:

- Nf6
- Bd6
- O-O

Really it is just natural development.

### Tarrasch Variation (3. Nd2):

You have a few ideas that you can play when against the Tarrasch. The top 3 being:

1. Closed Variation (Nf6 -> e5)
	1. The goal is to undermine the centre with c5, the timing is critical with this pawn break, if you miss the timing, you'll end up worse.
	2. Nc6 keeping tension is strong, slightly better than cxd4.
	3. Qb6 is always solid in the French structure.
	4. Be7 prepares castling
	5. O-O, etc.
2. Open Variation
	1. a
3. Rubenstein Variation
	1. a


### Advanced Variation (3. e5):

The advanced option, means it is difficult for you to develop your pieces. Then plan becomes to **remove and strike at these centre-pawns** so that you can develop your pieces fully.

c5 undermining the centre is a strong idea. As it directly challenges white and achieves our goal. White should not take as it weakens his structure and speeds up development from black. The e pawn is isolated and black can develop his bishop with Bxc5.

Igor suggests Bd7 (Euwe Variation). A tricky move that can punish mindless development of Bb5, with Nxe5! Winning a centre pawn.

A key idea for white is to develop his bishop to d3, aiming at your kingside and loading up ammo for an eventual attack. Rc8 has ideas of punishing this, you can trade in the centre then play Nb4, with ideas of trading down your knight for bishop. Nc2 forks are totally possible.

If you can remove the light bishop you'll have a comfortable game with ideas of:
- Ne7 - You want to rout the knight to the juicy f5 square to defend your king and attack the centre.
- h6 - You want to kick the bishop to Bh4, so that your Nf5 backs a greater punch.
- Qb6 - If your opponent persist with the pin, this is a good option as it can aim at the centre and weak b-pawns.
	- This move is a common motif in the French.

g5!? is a crazy move, which if you understand the theory, you can create madness on the board.
