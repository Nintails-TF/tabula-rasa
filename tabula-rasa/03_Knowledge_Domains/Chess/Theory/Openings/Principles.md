# Principles:

*Paul Morphy's piece activity and dynamism in the opening was key to his strength.*
## Fundamental Opening Principles:

1. Develop your pieces.
	1. Move each piece once, avoid moving the same piece twice.
	2. Focus on piece development, not pawn moves.
	3. Place your pieces on active squares.
	4. Ensure your pieces don't hinder your own development. e.g. Don't tangled up over yourself.
	5. Develop minor pieces first; avoid bringing out the queen early.
	6. Develop knights before bishops.
2. Castle early.
	1. Your king safety is paramount, an exposed king is ripe for tactical exploitation.
	2. If possible, stop your opponent from castling or delay it.
	3. Castling king-side is safer, castling queen-side is more explosive.
3. Control the centre
	1. Have your pieces aim at the centre.
	2. Get your centre pawns (d+e pawns) in the centre.
	3. Control the inner centre, if you can't, control the outer centre.

In essence: **Develop, Castle, Centre.**

**Time is the most important thing in the opening.** This is why the white pieces has an advantage from move 1, as they move first.

You shouldn't focus on:
- Winning material.
- Building a better pawn structure.
- Winning from an early attack or trick.

These things do help you win the game, though they are secondary to **Develop, Castle, and Control the centre.** 

So time is everything in the opening - a skilled player can make progress where a weaker player will waste their time.

### Morphy's Opera Game:

Morphy's Opera game is a brilliancy in itself. In the fact that Morphy emphasises activity and developing moves, frequently using tempo and attacking moves to develop rapidly. 

[Game]

This is all wrapped up in the romantic flare of sacrifices and is an explosive game. The main idea here is clear - **develop with tempo whenever you can.**

### Developing with Tempo I: Steinitz - Bird, London 1866:

Another lesson in tempo can be found here taught by Steinitz. During the 5th move black's queen is developed early and white can strike at it and develop pieces whilst attacking the queen.

[Game]

Steinitz activates his army, marching Black's queen into a trap where she is gobbled up. We see similar ideas in the Scandinavian Defence.

### Developing with Tempo II: Alekhine - Bruce, Plymouth 1938:

The 4th world champion Alexander Alekhine, shows us that we can develop with tempo by attacking loose pieces and/or threatening our opponents king to gain time to develop.

[Game]

What Alekhine shows us here, is that we can break opening principles, if we can gain more time by moving pieces a 2nd time. White constantly strikes at the bishop and makes it so black cannot develop.

Alekhine, breaks many opening principles here - but gains huge amounts of time due to his precise play. **If we can gain time, we should - it is our goal in the opening.**

### Developing without Queens I: Duras - Jes, Pisek 1912:

A common misconception is that if there is no queens, then a lead in development doesn't matter or is less effective. Remember that proper development is always decisive!

[Game]

Black sacrifices everything to remove queens, but all his pieces end up sleeping, whilst white is able to command his pieces to deliver a stunning checkmate.

Let's have a reminder to **develop with tempo** and **avoid bringing out your queen early.**

### Developing without Queens II: Steiner - Stiassny, Brunn 1925:

Another classical example of how pieces can run over a king if proper development is not achieved.

[Game]

In a Queen's Gambit structure, white gives up both pawns, but black keeps making pawn moves, whilst white gains rapid development. 

We see issues that black has with making pointless pawn moves, whilst white doesn't take material and go for a fork but activates his pieces further.

**Develop with tempo** and use threats to **gain time!** Don't make **unnecessary pawn moves**.

### Developing without Queens III: Dodge - Houghteling, Chicago 1905:

Now we even see how as the black pieces, by following opening principles, we can punish our opponent.

[Game]

Development can be stronger than winning material, and black shows us with a remarkable checkmate.

**Time is everything**

### Controlling the Centre I: Greco - NN, 1620:

An ancient game that still holds meaningful knowledge to this day. Greco shows us the power of controlling the centre.

[Game]

In this game, we see that black does develop more pieces than white, but doesn't fight for the centre and gets marched on by the centre pawns, losing immediately!

### Controlling the Centre II: Albin - Shipley, New York 1894:

Another Italian structure, and another domination of the centre. Let's see how Albin does it.

[Game]

We see the pawn march just like Greco did. Note that **the same ideas come up time and time again, master the principles and the right moves come naturally.** 

White develops his queen, but only after all his minor pieces are ready. As well as that black is so far behind in development he cannot attack said queen.

### Controlling the Centre III: Lee Passmoor vs. Leif E Warstad, 1999:

Being up in material matters little if your pieces cannot do anything. The Halloween gambit strikes the stage.

[Game]

This game illustrates that even being down material, if you use time well and control the centre, you can win! If you don't play unsound sacrifices and follow the steps you'll be even stronger.

**Control the centre** and **finish development.** If you are up material, you can give it away, but complete development.

## Conclusion:

Notice how the winning side had better pieces? A lead in time or tempo, results in better pieces. The same can be said out of tactics as well, when we have time, we can build and create tactics.

King safety was critical in every game, as the side that didn't or couldn't castle was punished.
