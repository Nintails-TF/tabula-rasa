# Future Development

### **900-1200: The Foundation**

_"One opening, played perfectly"_

**White:** London System (100%) 
**Black vs e4:** Caro-Kann 
**Black vs d4:** QGD Exchange

**Focus:** Don't learn variations - learn WHERE PIECES GO 
**Mantra:** "Same structure every game until it's automatic"

---

### **1200-1500: The Expansion**

_"Same structures, new move orders"_

**White:**
- London (70%)
- Add Catalan move order (1.d4, 2.Nf3, 3.g3) vs ...Nf6

**Black:** Same! (Caro + QGD)
- Maybe add Nimzo (3...Bb4) vs 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6 3.Nc3

**Focus:** Understanding pawn breaks (when to play c5, e5, etc.) 
**Mantra:** "Deepen, don't broaden"

---

### **1500-1700: The Refinement**

_"Handle all opponent attempts"_

**White:** Full d4 repertoire:
- London vs ...d5
- Catalan vs ...e6 setups
- System vs King's Indian

**Black:** Master all variations of your core:
- Caro: Classical, Advance, Exchange, Panov
- QGD: All white tries

**Focus:** Strategic plans in your structures 
**Mantra:** "Same openings, complete understanding"

---

### **1700-1900: The Polish**

_"From system to sophistication"_

**White:** Transition to mainline d4
- Real Catalan theory
- QGD from white side
- Anti-systems for everything

**Black:** Add one backup:
- Keep Caro, add French
- Keep QGD, master Nimzo completely

**Focus:** Move order subtleties 
**Mantra:** "Now I can play real theory"

---

### **1900-2000: The Master**

_"Complete technical repertoire"_

**White:**
- Main: 1.d4 complex
- Surprise: 1.c4 or 1.Nf3

**Black:**
