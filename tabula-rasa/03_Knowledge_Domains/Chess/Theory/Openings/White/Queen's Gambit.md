# Queen's Gambit:

## Core Ideas:




### Pros:



### Cons:

***
# Main Theory:

In most games your opponents will either play the QGD `2.e6` or the Slav/Semi-slav `2.c6`. 


***
# QGD Lines:

By committing to the QGD, black ends up in a French style pawn structure, giving him a weak light-squared bishop. 

`3.Nc3` or `3.Nf3` generally transpose into each other. `Nc3` helps prevent early queenside aggression and reinforce the centre for a potential `e4`. Where as `Nf3` is stronger in Catalan setups.

## **QGD Classical/Orthodox:**

The standard QGD line for maximum activity, central pressure. Requires more theory and is sharper than most.
## **QGD Exchange Variation:**

This leads to simple structures and avoids tactical complications. You end up having a symmetrical pawn structure, and can get to endgames easily.

## QGD Modern Variation:

A sharper line that can lead to fighting chances with the TMB, requires more theory but can surprise and opponent.

## **QGD 3 Knights:**

This leads to natural development and simple play, you have a flexible move order and solid structure.

## Catalan:

A long term positional squeeze on the light-squares, very advanced.

## London Style:

Solid development and avoiding theory.


***
# Slav Lines

In the Slav, black now has the option to develop his light-squared bishop more aggressively (`Bf5, Bg4`).

## Main Line (3. Nc3):


## **Exchange Line (3. cxd5)**:

The simplest response to the slav, leads to less ambitious positions, but leads to a rook endgames frequently. Symmetrical pawn structure.

***
# **Modern Line (3. Nf3):**

This often leads to a simple and natural position, if you choose it to be.

## Two Knights Attack (dxc4):

## Semi-Slav (4. e6):

Enables maximum fighting chances for black, with highly tactical and positional motifs in the position. Easy to go wrong and very theoretical, but strong if mastered.

### Meran (6. Bd3):

### Anti-Meran (6. Qc2):
