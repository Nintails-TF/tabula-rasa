# London System:


## Core Ideas:

The London System doesn't have any particular move order in a traditional sense, but is characterised by the London Bishop (Bf4) - outside the dark-pawn chain and the triangular pawn structure.

The idea is that in regular Queen's Gambit structures, if you play d4 and c4. You weaken your pawn d4 and make it easier for black to fight for the centre.

### Pros:

The London System is very solid and flexible, making it hard to take down and cannot be broken easily.

The London System is easy to learn, because no matter what black does, you can respond in the same way every time. Meaning it is attractive as a beginner.

You have the possibility of early attacks.
### Cons:

Black will get to decide how the position is played, so you will have to react well to whatever they throw at you, meaning you aren't in the driving seat of the game.

The position is more balanced, which means it can be more drawing.

The predictable structure of the London, enables opponents to plan against it.

# Opening Ideas:

In essence you are looking to get the following structure, and depending on how black responds, you can modify your move order:

*Fig. A typical London System structure.*

You basically have a three step process:
1. Develop the bishop outside the pawn chain.
2. Close up the pawn chain with e3 and c3.
3. Develop your knight to d2 and bishop to d3.

# Standard London Move Orders:

## Zukertort Variation (2. Nf3):

Moving with the knight first was popular when the London System was first introduced. This is because you don't commit anything, it is the most flexible choice, you don't say that you are playing the London, as you transpose into typical Queen's Gambit, Colle System, Trumpowski, Reverse Gruenfeld, etc.

Black usually responds with `Nf6, c5, Nc3,` etc.

The downside of this choice, is that black does have `5. Qb6` which is an annoying move. As by moving your bishop early, you undefend the b2 pawn. 

If you opponent has proper theoretical understanding, you can end up in some tough positions. This moves onto the next point that `2. Bf4` is a superior pathway into the London, as one tempo can make the difference.

It isn't that this move is wrong, because you can use it to either go into the London or other systems, but if you are ONLY going for the London then this move isn't critical.
## Accelerated London System (2. Bf4):

The Accelerated London Move order is valuable in that you get your setup as quickly as possible. It can work well against certain black move orders. As in you can meet `5. Qb6` with `Nd2`, and in the resulting line, you can halt blacks attack.

In essence, if you are not afraid to play the London into any setup, then this choice is superior, but is less flexible into other openings as a drawback.
