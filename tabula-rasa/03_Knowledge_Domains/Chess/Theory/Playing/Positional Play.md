# Capablanca's Ideas:

1. Always keep your pieces active.
	1. *A piece should control many squares as it can. Ideally centre squares, so developing forward is key.*
2. Always keep an eye on your opponents threats.
	1. *You never want to blunder a tactic or piece and give your opponent a free win.*
3. Neutralize opponents pieces on your side of the board.
	1. *Trading down pieces that are on your side of the board or are going to infiltrate is solid.*
4. In an endgame attack pawns.
	1. *They are immobile and good targets to break open the position.*
