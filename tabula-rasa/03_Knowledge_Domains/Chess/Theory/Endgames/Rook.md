# Rook:

## Lucena's Position:

The Lucena position is a winning endgame pattern, when you have a rook vs rook + pawn. With the following conditions:

1. Your pawn is on the 7th rank
2. Your king is in front of the pawn
3. Opponents king is cut off

First you must recognise the position. Then you must start to **build the bridge.** 
### Building the Bridge:

Moving your rook to the 4th rank or 4 squares away from your king, you create a corridor or a bridge for your king. For this to work, the opponents king must be 2 files away from the pawn, otherwise once you do the bridge you will lose your pawn.

## Philidor's Position:

If you are the one who is losing, remember the following guidelines:

1. Keep your king in front of the opposing pawn.
	1. This is a similar idea to the k+p endgames. 
	2. You at least want to get to the promotion square.
	3. Don't drift off more than 1 rank away from the pawn.
2. Your rook needs to cut off the opposing king.
	1. If the opposing king tries to push. You attack from behind.
	2. Stay on the long-side.
