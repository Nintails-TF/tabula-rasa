# King + Pawn

You roughly have 50k-100k king + pawn endgame setups, with around 200 of them being the most relevant.

100 Games you must know, Dvoertsky's Endgame Manual, and Fine's Basic Chess endings, contain lots of these key principles, positions, and ideas.

## Opposition:

When two kings face each other on the same rank, file, or diagonal. With one square between them.

- **Direct Opposition**: Kings facing each other with one square between
	- Whoever moves first loses.
	- When blockading use triangular king movement to keep the block up.
- **Distant Opposition**: Kings on same file/rank/diagonal, odd squares apart.
	- This means you can force direct opposition later, e.g. e1 to e8 is distant opposition
- **Diagonal Opposition**: Kings on diagonal, odd squares apart

Opposition isn't important all of the time, key squares take precedent. But opposition can help you take key squares.
## Key Squares:

- **Definition**: The 3 squares directly in front of your pawn
- **Rule**: Control key squares = winning, lose key squares = drawing
- **Example**: Pawn on e4, key squares are d5, e5, f5
