## Study Method
1. **Play through game without engine** - Understand the ideas first
	1. See how the game plays out, get an initial response. (15 minutes)
2. **Guess the moves** - Pause and think what you'd play
	1. Start from move 1, hide notation, figure out what you would play here.
	2. If correct
		1. Why did you see it? What pattern did you see?
	3. If wrong
		1. Why did the master play differently, What did you miss?
	4. Annotate your responses.
3. **Annotate key moments** - Write down critical decisions
4. **Compare with master annotations** - See what you missed
5. **Extract principles** - What general lesson does this teach?
6. **Replay periodically** - Reinforce understanding
