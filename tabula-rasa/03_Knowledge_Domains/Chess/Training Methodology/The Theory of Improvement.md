# Anti-Blunder:

The main idea behind being very good at anything, is reducing your unforced errors and capitalising on your opponents unforced errors, the game or task only truly gets hard when your opponents stop making unforced errors and so do you. **That is when the game actually begins.**

In chess, this refers to blunders.

If the walls in your house are off by a meter, the house will fall down (blunder). If you are off by centimetres or millimetres (Mistakes and Inaccuracies). The house will be unstable, but it will still stand.

In games like chess, where you have little to no comeback chances, avoiding huge sweeping errors matters more. But in any game, if you hit a critical mass of disadvantage, you'll lose 99.99% of the time.

**Simple Unsafe Blunder (SUBs):** Giving the opponent an easy tactic/resource that wins material.
**Simple Missed Blunder (SMBs):** Missing a simple tactic that wins material.
**Hits:** You succeed in punishing your opponent for making a SUB
**Game Type:**
- A: I made the first SUB
	- You make the first blunder, so you'll generally lose. Practice fighting chess.
- B: Opponent made the first SUB, and I missed it (so I made the first SMB)
	- Your opponent makes the first blunder and you missed it, so the game stays even.
- C: Opponent made the first SUB, and I Hit
	- Your opponent makes the first blunder and you hit it, so you have an advantage.
- D: No SUBs occurred in the game
	- Neither player blundered and the game stays even, this is "real" chess.

So add up your SUBs and SMBs to figure out your blunder rate, then look to decrease these stats. We want games that are C and Ds, not As and Bs.

You may lose games in which that are C and Ds; then win games that are As and Bs, that's fine. 

The idea is, that if most of your games are within D, within say a 10 game sample size, you would have to go deeper into chess and look at the centimetres and millimetres.

# The Foundations Are King:

In any task, you have to boil the complexity down to what actually matters. In chess what does that mean?

Phase 1:
- Looking at all the moves or options that you have.
	- Chess Count Quiz App - Set a goal and look for all of your moves.

Phase 2:
- Finding simple and easy tactics.
	- Easy puzzles - Goal is to get them all right.
- Avoiding giving simple and easy tactics
	- Easy puzzles - Flip the board, go back one, find a better move, goal is zero mistakes.

Phase 3:
- Scanning all your opponents options.
	- Chess Count Quiz App - Look at all of opponents moves with 1 step ahead.

Phase 4:
- Training Calculation:
	- Do a harder puzzle and calculate all possible moves and replies.

Integration, practice lessons in actual games, focus on making sensible moves that don't blunder the game mainly.
