# Daily Practice (3-4 hours) - "Capablanca Development Phase":

**Morning Session (90 minutes):**
- **30 minutes:** Tactical puzzles - but focus on clean, forcing sequences (pins, forks, back-rank mates) rather than wild sacrifices
- **30 minutes:** Study one annotated Capablanca game - focus on his logical move choices and natural development
- **30 minutes:** Endgame study - master one position completely each day (K+P vs K, basic rook endings, etc.)

**Evening Session (90-120 minutes):**

- **45-60 minutes:** Play 2-3 longer time control games (30+0 or 45+45) - this teaches you to think like Capablanca did
- **30 minutes:** Analyse those games deeply - ask "What would the most natural move be?" at key moments
- **15-30 minutes:** Opening principles study - learn WHY moves work, not just memorizing lines

**Weekly Focus:**

- **Monday/Wednesday/Friday:** Emphasize tactical patterns and endgames
- **Tuesday/Thursday:** Focus on positional understanding through master games
- **Saturday:** Long study session on Capablanca's style and technique
- **Sunday:** Tournament practice or review week's games

**Capablanca-specific elements:**

- Always choose the most natural, logical move when multiple options exist
- Practice simplifying to winning endgames when you have an advantage
- Study positions where quiet moves are stronger than flashy ones

This routine builds the foundation while instilling Capablanca's principled, natural approach to chess.
