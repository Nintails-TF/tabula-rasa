# Scheduling

## Capablanca's 4-Hour Practice Day:

### **Hour 1: Foundation (Morning - Fresh Mind)**

**60 min: Endgame Mastery**
- Continue endgame study.
- Focus on your weak spots: "kings in corners" and "removing pawns to maintain opposition"
- Target: 15 positions, 100% accuracy (quality over quantity)

**30 min: Master Game Study**
- ONE Capablanca game, deeply understood
- Write down the key principle learned
- Add it to your "Chess Principles & Techniques" notes

### **Hour 2-3: Serious Play (Peak Focus)**

**60 min: Two Quality Games (30 min each)**
- 15+10 or longer time control.
- Before each move ask: "What would the most natural move be?".
- Note critical positions during play.

**30 min: Immediate Analysis**
- Analyse without engine first.
- Focus on your "One thing to remember" principle.
- Only then check with engine.

### **Hour 4: Reinforcement (Relaxed Study)**

**20 min: Tactical Patterns**
- Focus on removing the defender (you've noted this weakness multiple times!)
- Simple forks and pins.
- Simple mating patterns.

**20 min: Opening Principles**
- Not memorizing variations!
- Understanding pawn structures from your games.
- Why moves are played (like why Bf5 in the Caro-Kann)

**20 min: Review & Log**
- Update your game analysis.
- Review today's endgame positions.
- Plan tomorrow's focus based on today's weaknesses.
