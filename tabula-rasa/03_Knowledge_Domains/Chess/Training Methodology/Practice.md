# Practice

**Your Development Plan:**

**Phase 1: Build the Foundation (6-12 months)**
- Master basic tactics until pattern recognition is instant
- Learn opening principles deeply, not just moves - understand _why_ each move makes sense
- Study Capablanca's simple games with annotations
- Master essential endgames completely (this was his secret weapon)

**Phase 2: Develop Natural Play (6-18 months)**
- Focus on clear, logical moves over complicated tactics
- Practice simplifying to favourable endgames when ahead
- Study positions where simple moves are stronger than complex ones
- Develop intuition for when to trade pieces vs keep them

**Phase 3: Endgame Mastery (ongoing)**
- Go deep on endgame theory as you planned
- This gives you the confidence to simplify positions others fear
- Learn to create small advantages and nurse them to victory

**Daily Practice:**
- Tactics (but focus on clean, forcing sequences)
- Play games where you consciously choose simple, strong moves
- Analyse your games asking "What would the most natural move be here?"

**Capablanca's Secret:** His confidence came from knowing that if he could reach an endgame, he'd probably win it. That's exactly what your endgame mastery plan will give you.
