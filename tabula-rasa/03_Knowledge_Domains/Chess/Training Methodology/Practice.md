# Chess Training System: 1000‚Üí2000 ELO Summary

## Core Philosophy

The path to 2000 ELO combines **Soviet systematic training** with **Capablanca's endgame-first approach**, validated by modern cognitive science. Success comes from building 50,000+ chess patterns through deliberate practice, not raw talent.

**Key Principles:**

- Chess expertise = pattern recognition, not calculation depth
- Endgames first (clearer principles, fewer pieces)
- Daily consistency > sporadic intensity
- 2-4 year realistic timeline with 2-3 hours daily

## The Science

- **Chunking**: Masters process 3.6 pieces/chunk vs 2.7 for intermediates
- **Deliberate Practice**: 5,000 hours in first decade for GMs
- **Spaced Repetition**: Review just before forgetting for optimal retention
- **Neuroplasticity**: Chess training creates measurable brain improvements
