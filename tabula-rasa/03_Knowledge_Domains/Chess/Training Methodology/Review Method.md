# **Phase 1: Immediate Post-Game (10 minutes)**

**1. Critical Moments Log**
- Write down 3-5 positions where you felt the game changed
- Note any moves where you spent significant time
- Mark where you felt confused or uncertain

**2. Blunder Check** (from Finegold's principles)
- Identify any hanging pieces or obvious tactical mistakes
- Ask: "Did I check for my opponent's threats after each move?"
- Note any moment where you "relaxed" and lost focus

### **Phase 2: Deep Analysis (20-30 minutes)**

**1. Opening Review (5 minutes)**
- Could you explain each opening move to a coach? (Finegold's test)
- Did you follow your principles: Development, Centre control, King safety?
- Where did you first deviate from your planned system?

**2. Move-by-Move Questions** For each critical position, ask:
- "If my opponent had another move, what would they do?"
- "What was my plan here? What was their plan?"
- "Did this move improve my position or just attack something?"
- "Were there any forcing moves (checks, captures, attacks) I missed?"

**3. Turning Points**
- Identify the exact moment the advantage shifted
- What principle was violated? (Development, king safety, pawn structure, etc.)
- Could you have prevented their best moves?

**4. Endgame Transition**
- When should you have started thinking about the endgame?
- Did you trade pieces correctly for the resulting position?
- Apply your K+P endgame knowledge: Were there key squares you missed?

### **Phase 3: Pattern Recognition (10 minutes)**

**1. Tactical Patterns**
- List any tactical themes that appeared (pins, forks, discovered attacks)
- Note which patterns you saw vs. which you missed

**2. Positional Themes**
- Pawn structure changes and their consequences
- Piece activity comparison at different stages
- Space advantages and how they were used/lost

**3. Psychological Patterns**
- When did you play too fast? Too slow?
- Any "hope chess" moments? ("I hope they don't see...")
- Emotional decisions vs. logical ones
