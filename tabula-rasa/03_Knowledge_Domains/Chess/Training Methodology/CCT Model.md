# CCT Model
## The 3 Phases

### Phase 1: Untimed AI - Perfect Habit (Weeks 1-4)

**Settings:**
- Bot: 1000-1100 rated
- Time: NONE (untimed/analysis mode)
- Duration: 30 min daily

**Process:**
Explain internally each check, capture and threat that you and your opponent has.
```
My Checks:
My Captures: 
My Threats: 
Opp Checks: 
Opp Captures: 
Opp Threats: 
```

**Post-Game (5 min):**
- SUBs made: 
- CCT skips: 
- Opponents SUBs caught: 

**Graduation Criteria:**
- [ ] 5 consecutive games with ZERO SUBs
- [ ] 5 consecutive games with ZERO CCT skips
- [ ] CCT completed in under 20 seconds per move
## Practice Tactics and Endgames (30mins):

- Play tactics that have been missed in the games.
- Play endgames struggled with in games.

Make sure they are easy and do them right.

### Phase 2: Timed AI - Speed Building (Weeks 5-8)

**Settings:**
- Bot: 1100-1200 rated
- Time: 15+10
- Duration: 30 min daily

**Process:**
- CCT mentally (no paper)
- Track time remaining at game end

**Post-Game (5 min):**
- Time remaining: ___
- SUBs made: ___
- Flagged? Yes/No

**Reality Check:**
- **Flagged or <2 min left** → Back to Phase 1 for 1 week
- **Finished with 3+ min** → Continue Phase 2

**Graduation Criteria:**
- [ ] 5 consecutive games with 3+ minutes remaining
- [ ] Zero SUBs in those 5 games
- [ ] CCT feels natural, not forced

---

### Phase 3: Real Games - Apply Under Pressure (Weeks 9+)

**Settings:**
- Real opponents
- Time: 15+10
- Frequency: 3-4 games per week

**Post-Game (10 min):**
- Flagged? Yes/No
- SUBs made: ___
- CCT skips (estimate): ___

**Regression Protocol:**
- **Flagged 2 games in a row** → 1 week Phase 2
- **3+ SUBs in one game** → 3 days Phase 1
- **Flagged AND 2+ SUBs** → 1 week Phase 1

- Week 7: Finish with 4-6 min left
- Week 8: Finish with 5+ min left

### Phase 3 (Real Games):
- Week 9+: Finish with 3+ min, zero flags
- Month 4+: CCT unconscious

## Daily Practice Template

### Phase 1 Session (30 min)
**0-2 min:** Setup paper, review yesterday's skips
**2-25 min:** Play untimed, write CCT every move
**25-30 min:** Count SUBs and CCT skips, set tomorrow's focus

### Phase 2 Session (30 min)
**0-2 min:** Mental prep: "CCT every move"
**2-25 min:** Play timed, CCT mentally, note skips
**25-30 min:** Record time left, SUBs, decide readiness

---

## The Flagging Rule

**This is your honest feedback:**

✓ **Flag vs AI in Phase 2** → CCT not automatic → Back to Phase 1
✓ **Finish with <2 min vs AI** → CCT too slow → Stay in Phase 2
✓ **Finish with 3+ min vs AI, flag vs humans** → Pressure breaks CCT → More Phase 2
✓ **Finish with 5+ min vs AI** → Ready for Phase 3

**No excuses. Flag = Not ready = Go back.**

## Quick Reference

**The 6 Questions (CCT):**
1. My checks?
2. My captures?
3. My threats?
4. Opponent's checks?
5. Opponent's captures?
6. Opponent's threats?

**Success Metric:**
- Phase 1: Can answer all 6 without thinking
- Phase 2: Can answer all 6 in <10 seconds
- Phase 3: Questions are automatic, you just "see" threats
