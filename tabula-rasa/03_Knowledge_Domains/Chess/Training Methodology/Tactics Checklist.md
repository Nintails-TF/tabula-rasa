# Tactics Checklist
### 1. Freeze & Observe

- Before touching a piece, **count material** and **note the king safety** for both sides.
- Ask: _"If this were my turn in a real game, what would I be worried about right now?"_
### 2. Threat Scan (Checks, Captures, Threats — CCT)

- **For YOU:** List all possible **checks**, **captures**, and **direct threats**.
- **For OPPONENT:** Imagine it’s their move — list their checks, captures, threats.

> This is the single most important habit for avoiding “missed simple moves.”
### 3. Identify the Tactical Theme

- Look for **pins, forks, skewers, discovered attacks, deflections, overloads, mating nets**.
- Ask: _"Which motif do I think is in play here?"_
### 4. Candidate Moves List

- Write down (mentally or physically) **2–4 candidate moves** that seem promising.
- Don’t just dive into the first flashy sacrifice you see.
### 5. Calculate Forcing Lines First

- Start with the most forcing move (check > capture > threat).
- In your head, **play the move, imagine opponent’s _best_ reply**, and continue until the position is quiet or you win material/mate.
### 6. Safety Check Before Moving
- Return to step 2 **for the final position** — are you walking into a fork, skewer, or mate?
- If yes → back up and try another candidate.
### 7. Commit & Review
- Make your move.
- If wrong, **name the missed pattern** (e.g., “I missed a back rank mate”) so your brain tags it for future recognition.
