# Chapter 1 - First Principles:

# Basic Checkmates

A student must understand the value of the pieces, which is done by learning common mating techniques. These consist of the Queen, Rook and two Bishops checkmates.

---
## Rook Checkmate:
**Moves Required:** Under 20 moves  
**Difficulty:** Fundamental
### Principle:
*Drive the king to the last rank or file on the board.*
### Technique:
1. **King Positioning**: Keep your king on the same rank or file as the opposing king
    - Exception: If the opposing king is on the 6th or 2nd rank, your king can best occupy the centre square
2. **Central Kings**: If the opposing king is in the centre of the board, advance your king first to one side of the opponent's king
3. **Confinement**: Push back the opposing king or confine it with the rook after positioning your king

### Key Concepts
- Box method: Gradually reduce the opponent's king's available squares
- Rook safety: Always ensure your rook cannot be captured
- King coordination: Bring your king closer to support the final mate

## Queen Checkmate:
**Moves Required:** Under 10 moves  
**Difficulty:** Fundamental

### Principle:
*Use the knight's space away principle to restrict the opponent's king.*
### Technique
1. **Queen Positioning**: Place your queen a knight's move away from the opponent's king
2. **King Support**: Bring your king into the game to assist
3. **Final Position**: Lock the opponent's king into two squares maximum

### Key Concepts
- The queen is powerful enough to control many squares
- Avoid stalemate by giving the opponent's king at least one legal move until checkmate
- Use checks to drive the king to the edge of the board

## Two Bishops Checkmate

**Moves Required:** Under 30 moves  
**Difficulty:** Intermediate
### Principle
*Use the bishops to control diagonal squares and drive the king to a corner.*
### Technique
1. **Bishop Coordination**: Position bishops to control key diagonals
2. **Corner Drive**: Force the opponent's king toward a corner square
3. **King Support**: Use your king to help restrict the opponent's movement

### Key Concepts
- More complex than rook or queen checkmates
- Requires understanding of how bishops work together
- The opponent's king must be driven to a corner of the same colour as one of your bishops

## Practice Guidelines

### Learning Order
1. **Queen Checkmate** 
2. **Rook Checkmate**
3. **Two Bishops Checkmate**

### Success Targets
- Queen: 100% success rate in under 10 moves
- Rook: 100% success rate in under 16 moves
- Two Bishops: 100% success rate in under 30 moves

### Common Mistakes to Avoid
- **Stalemate**: Always ensure the opponent has legal moves until checkmate
- **Piece Safety**: Never hang your attacking pieces
- **Time Management**: These are technical positions - accuracy over speed initially
