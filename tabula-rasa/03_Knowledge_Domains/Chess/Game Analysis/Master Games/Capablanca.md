# Capablanca:

## Capablanca Vs Marshall, New York 1909, Round 1:

**White:** Marshall
**Black:** Capablanca
**Opening:** QGD - Tarrasch Defence

Move by move analysis
- 1. d4 d5
- 2. c4 e6
- 3. Nc3 c5
	- Capablanca, decides for the Tarrasch Defence, I would of likely gone for Nf6, the more classical line. I believe that the Tarrasch is more aggressive, as black can develop his dark bishop earlier and to a more active square if white takes the c-pawn.
	- Also you want to push c5 before playing Nc6, so that you don't block the c-pawn from development.
	- So this choice seems somewhat flexible as you can still choose where to develop your dark bishop and knights.
- 4. cxd5 exd5
	- Marshall removes the d-pawn, then Capablanca trades it back. If white plays something passive, then black can undermine the centre with cxd4.
	- Marshall has to either take or reinforce c4 with e3 or b3.
		- e3 ends up in a basically symmetrical position, which usually seems more drawish and better for black.
		- b3 is a bad move, as it forces the queen to capture the pawn after cxd4, which enables black to develop Nc6 with tempo.
	- In essence, there isn't really any better option for white other than to take.
- 5. Nf3 Nc6
	- Both moves are natural and what I chose to play. Both players need to develop pieces.
	- White: e3 isn't good as it limits the dark-squared bishop.
	- Black: Nf6 is inferior as white can pin and threaten the paws, Nc6 cannot be stopped.
- 6. g3 Be6
	- I guessed wrong on both moves. I thought white would go Bg5 developing with tempo, and no matter what black would continue with Nf6.
	- g3 states that the attack will occur on the d5 pawn, where as Be6 is a defensive move that cannot be stopped.
		- It makes it so that white's fianchettoed bishop is worse.
- 7. Bg2 Nf6
	- Natural development that I spotted and would of played.
- 8. Bg5 h6
	- I guessed wrong again, I assumed that white would O-O and black would play Be7.
	- Why is h6 used as defence rather than Be7? I suppose it is because the bishop is already doing things, there is no need to move it around.
- 9. Bxf6 Qxf6
	- Marshall's dark bishop doesn't have many good squares to go to at the moment, so he trades it down.
- 10. O-O cxd4
	- I saw the Marshall move, but I thought that potentially castling queenside for Capablanca would be better as it x-rays the queen and brings a rook to the d-file again blunting the light bishop from Marshall.
	- Capablanca has a simpler idea, he takes the pawn that he attacks 3 times and Marshall defends only twice.
- 11. Nb5 Rc8
	- Marshall's moves is obvious, it is the only decent square for the knight, and he cannot recapture right away without losing material.
	- I thought that Bc5 was an idea for Capablanca, but is falls to pieces because Marshall can develop his rook with tempo -> Rc1
		- But then Bb6? And the pawn remains defended?
- 12. Nfxd4 Nxd4
	- Another exchange.
- 13. Nxd4 Bc5
	- Capablanca develops with tempo.
- 14. Nxe6 fxe6
	- Marshall defends his knight under a double attack by trading it down. Capablanca, then takes towards the centre and has a fortified centre.
- 15. Qa4+ Kf7
	- Marshalls move makes sense, we want to revoke castling rights. First for Capablanca, I thought that Kd6 was better, but after white can play b4 and complicate the position, it locks Capablanca's dark squared bishop to b6.
		- But b4, enables Bd4 striking at the rook in the corner, this doesn't feel that bad actually. Maybe the engine or a GM would say otherwise.
	- I just don't like putting my king directly behind my queen it feels scary.
- 16. Rc1 Rf8
	- I'm able to see Marshall's move more easily, but Capablanca's moves I don't quiet see in the same way, but when he plays the move all of a sudden I see and it makes sense.
	- Marshalls threat isn't real yet, so we want to remain flexible, Capablanca creates a battery and places his rook on a semi-open file, it just looks very solid and improving.
- 17. e3 Qe7
	- Marshall's pawn move makes sense as 3 attackers are loaded onto his kingside, I prefer Kg8 to Capablanca's queen move, In that I don't want to open the door for any checks or tactics.
- 18. Rc3 Rc7
	- Both players doubling up rooks.
- 19 Rfc1 Rfc8
	- Both players still doubling up rooks.
- 20. Qg4 Qf6
	- I don't see the idea behind these queen moves. This is something worth looking deeper into, but I'm struggling to understand it at the moment.
- 21. a3 Bd6
	- Marshall wants to prep b4 to start winning control over the open c file, where as Capablanca then moves his bishop back to the centre offering an exchange. But on his terms.
	- I like how Marshall is putting all his pawns on dark squares which dulls the effectiveness of Capablanca's dark bishop.
- 22. Rxc7+ Rxc7
- 23. Rxc7+ Bxc7
	- The rooks come off the board and the endgame is Q+B+4P each with wrong coloured bishops.
	- Is this endgame drawn? Or does Marshall not want to go into an endgame against Capablanca and perpetually checks him with the queen resulting in a draw?
- 24. Qb4 Bb6
- 25. a4 Qe7
- 26. Qf4+ Qf6
- 27. Qb4 Qe7
- 28. Qf4+ Qf6
- 29. Qb4 Qe7
- 30. Qf4+ qf6
	- The perpetual check, nothing more to be said and a 3 fold-repetition draw.

1/2-1/2

### Critical Moments:
- Move 6-7
	- Marshall locked his light-squared bishop with the fianchetto idea, where as Capablanca recognised that the d5 pawn must be reinforced in order to dull Marshall's attempt at gaining an active bishop.
	- It's a very prophylactic defence from Capablanca and I think Marshall didn't have the right idea here. But it's hard for me to refute this as it simply seemed like naturally development at the time.
- Moves 15-17
	-  I can't help about think that this game could of been different if Capablanca had moved his king to g8, which would of prevented a perpetual check in the future. His king was active, but I'm not sure I'd keep my king on a semi open f7 file with queens on the board.
- Moves 22-23
	- The decision to trade down and simplify the position, why then? I assume because it's difficult to make progress in any other way.


### The Lesson:

**Marshall's lesson** is that he removed his weaknesses on the board by trading them down. This meant that Capablanca couldn't continue his pressure and targeting pieces or pawns on weak squares.

**Capablanca's lesson** is that he only moved his pieces where they needed to be at the correct time, he didn't fix his pieces into certain ideas, but kept them flexible and ready to respond to anything Marshall did.

Mainly, it's about defence this game. In which both players did generate threats but had to have pieces ready to respond to them. 

I do think Capablanca played better because his game seemed more fluid, where as Marshall often felt at times like he only had one or two moves that were solid and he had to exchange down, which plays into Capablanca's strengths as a player.

### Take Home Principle:

**Marshall:** *Minimise your positional weaknesses by trading them down.*
**Capablanca:** *Do not move pieces that are already active or fulfilling a valuable role.*
