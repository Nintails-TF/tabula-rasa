## Morphy Paul Vs NN, New Orleans 1848:

**White:** *Paul Morphy*
**Black:** *Anonymous*
**Opening:** ECO C20 - I don't know
## Move by Move Analysis:
- 1. e4 e5
- 2. h3?! d5?!
	- h3 isn't common, but it does prevent early light-squared bishop with Bg4 and knight infiltrations (Nc6 -> Ng4). You see this defence in the Stafford gambit, but here, it more or less wastes white's time.
	- d5 fails to capitalize on the situation, white can simply take a centre pawn for free here and continue natural development, whilst black is on the defensive.
	- For either player, simple development of the knights is better, as the take initiative in the centre.
- 3. exd5 Bc5?
	- Bc5 as a move is confusing, because now white is able to protect his d5 pawn through options such as Nc3, c4, Bc4, etc. The advantage is that black does target the weak f2 pawn in whites camp.
- 4. Bc4? c6?!
	- Bc4 is a mistake, as it enables black to tactically win a pawn. ( 4...Bxf2+ 5.Kxf2 Qh4+ 6.Kf1 Qxc4+ 7.Qe2 Qxd5 ). Now black would of been better, since white's king is more exposed.
	- c6 isn't a bad idea if black missed the tactic, as it undermines the centre, if white takes, black is able to develop, it loads up pressure on the d5 pawn.
- 5. Nc3 Nf6
- 6. d3 a5?
	- Nf3 seems more accurate than d3, we develop another piece, and prep castling. d3 does open the dark squared bishop and helps fight for the centre, but Nf3 is just better here.
	- a5 is a nothing move, black can remove a centre pawn and trade down the pieces and have a better centre, if white checks, you block with Nc6 not the bishop, as you don't want to severe the guard of the queen.
- 7. Bg5 Nd7??
	- Morphy develops naturally, whilst his opponent ruins his own pawn structure, giving Morphy's light bishop access to the f7 target.
	- b5 could work to trap the bishop, Morphy would likely sac the exchange and start giving checks, but it's really quite a nice position for black.
- 8. dxc6 bxc6
- 9. Nf3 O-O
	- Nf3 is very strong, since Morphy threatens Bxf5 and no matter what way black takes back, it isn't good for them.
		- Nxf6 - Hangs the e 5 pawn.
		- Qxf6 - Allows Ne4 striking at the bishop and queen.
		- gxf6 - Weakens black's kingside pawn structure.
- 10. O-O h6
- 11. Bh4 Qc7
- 12. d4 exd4
- 13. Nxd4 Bd6
- 14. Nf5 Bh2+
- 15. Kh1 Ne5
- 16. Bb3 Ba6
- 17. Re1 Ng6
- 18. Bxf6 gxf6
- 19. Qh5
