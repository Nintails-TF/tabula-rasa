# To Improve

## **Major Recurring Issues**

### 1. **Capture Selection Problems** (Appears in 4+ games)

- **Pattern**: Consistently choosing the wrong piece to capture with
- **Examples**:
    - Taking with bishop instead of pawn (supersexman game)
    - Taking with queen instead of bishop, ruining pawn structure (Virtualjavi game)
    - Taking with queen instead of bishop, missing development (PapaGroundHog game)
- **Root cause**: Not following your own protocol of evaluating which piece should capture

### 2. **Tactical Blindness** (Appears In 5+ games)

- **Pattern**: Missing both your own tactics and opponent's threats
- **Examples**:
    - Missing trapped knight on move 13 (Swetalsuthar10)
    - Missing simple pawn-winning tactic on move 18 (ghostofmichaelmyres)
    - Missing pin tactic after emotional blunder (Raychane)
- **Timing**: Often occurs after mistakes when emotions take over

### 3. **Premature/Unnecessary Sacrifices** (3 games)

- **Pattern**: Sacrificing material without proper calculation
- **Examples**:
    - Nxa7?? knight sac (vicking7006)
    - Nxb5? unnecessary knight for pawns (Raychane)
- **Root cause**: Tunnel vision on attacks rather than improving position

## **Positive Trends**

### 1. **Improving Opening Understanding**

- Recognition of center control importance
- Better piece development patterns
- Understanding when to break principles for tactics

### 2. **Growing Positional Awareness**

- Identifying key squares and outposts
- Understanding pawn structure consequences
- Recognizing superior positions

## **Emotional/Mental Patterns**

### 1. **Emotional Spiral After Mistakes**

- Getting "in your head" after blunders
- Missing subsequent tactical opportunities
- Loss of focus when frustrated

### 2. **Rushing Under Pressure**

- Making quick moves without proper evaluation
- Tunnel vision on single ideas
- Not following established protocols
