## Blunders

## My Blunders (SUBs):

| Game | Move #     | What happened?                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| ---- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1.   | `4. Nh6??` | The fact that `5. Bc4` was an option and enabled white to keep loading up pressure on my weak f-pawn, better choice would of been `5. g6` to defend the f-pawn. My knight doesn't want to be on the rim like this. |
|      |            |                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

## Opponent Blunders (SUBs):

| Game | Move #     | Caught?       | What happened                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ---- | ---------- | ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1.   | `4. Ng5??` | No            | I picked the wrong way to defend, see my SUB in game 1 for further details.                                                                                                                     |
| 1.   | `5. h4??`  | Yes           | Opponent trapped their own queen, I saw `5. Bg4` and won material.                                                                                                                              |
| 2.   | `6. b4??`  | Yes (delayed) | Opponent pushed his b-pawn which did not develop a piece, and enabled me to play `a5` threatening to win the pawn and activate my rook and bishop on the diagonal. The move was very weakening. |
| 3.   | `7.e4??`   | Yes           | White miscounted attackers and tried to strike in the centre, but I was able to recapture and fork his king and knight.                                                                         |

## CCT Skips

| Game | Description                                            | Reason                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

| 1.   | Many CCT skips                                         | Not thinking during obvious moves, the whole point of CCT is to think during obvious moves to prevent blunders and slowly increase speed over time. **Obvious**                                                                                                                   |
| 2.   | Taking more time                                       | I took more time, even on obvious moves, I made sure to check if my opponent had counter-play, this checking pattern, especially about considering what my opponent's candidate moves would be if I played a move, stopped me from making mistakes and blunders. **90s CCT**      |
| 3.   | Good at the start of the game but rushed when winning. | I did the CCT when I was in an even game, but after I was up a million material, I didn't do the full checking of my opponents moves or what their response would be. This is a bad habit to develop so even in winning games I need to stick to my pawn. **Rushing** **60s CCT** |
|      |                                                        |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
