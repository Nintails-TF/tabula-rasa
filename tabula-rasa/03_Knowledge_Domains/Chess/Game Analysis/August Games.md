## Game 1:

Date: 
Time Control: 15 + 10
Pieces: 
Opening:
Result:

Critical Positions: (diagram or notation)
1. Position after move 5: 
   - My plan: I struck in the centre with e5, since I had 2 attackers on that square, they had 1 defender and I could have a dominant centre.
   - Their plan: To play in an King's Indian style and slowly develop pieces by fianchettoing them.
   - What I missed: I took with the bishop rather than the pawn, so my attack didn't instantly threaten his knight to move. Which made my attack much worse as it was slow.
2. Move 16: Nb4??
	1. My opponent hung their knight, it did weaken my king, but because my minor and heavy pieces were close, my king was never in any real danger.
	2. What I missed: I could of threatened his king much earlier with Qh6, it isn't mate, but it puts him under lots of stress, I can win pawns and then I can slide back to help my king again.

Blunders/Mistakes:
- Move 15: I didn't think about using a pawn storm on the king side and ramming my h pawn into his king's pawn structure.
- Why: I've never really launched a pawn storm before, because I don't normally castle queenside.

Key Learning:
- Opening: Think carefully before deciding what piece to take with, if you can attack a piece with a pawn and force a response, usually that's the best option.
- Middlegame: Good job playing solid and not making obvious mistakes. Keep in mind the power of pawn storms. My middle game plan sort of boiled down to pushing a pawn down the centre of the board, I think it would of been better to look at where he was weak, and strike there.
- Endgame: N/A

One thing to remember: *Playing even inaccurate moves, as long as you don't make obvious mistakes sometimes is enough to win. Not blundering is important.*
