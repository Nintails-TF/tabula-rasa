## [29Ahmed (777) VS NintailsChess (822)](https://www.chess.com/analysis/library/25FaKQBkC6/analysis)

Date: 04/08/25
Time Control: 15+10
Pieces: Black
Opening: Caro-Kann Advanced
Result: Win (Due to abandonment)

Critical Positions: (diagram or notation):
- 3. Why is Bf5 considered a good theoretical move in the Caro-kann? 
	- *If you don't get your light-squared bishop out early, it becomes tough to develop it and actually find a good square, but it isn't the only option.
	- You do need to be careful, as you don't particularly want to have the bishop get traded and for you to play exf5, since it weakens you pawn structure.*
		- Ne7 or Bg6 are solid ideas to defend the bishop.
- 9. kf8 Getting your king castled isn't always necessary, as long as he is safe. 
	- In this theoretical line, the king shifts over to defend g7 square from the queen.
	- Beware, white can start a pawn storm since he is uncastled on black's kingside, so black has to be somewhat defensive. 
		- But this requires rather sharp play.

Blunders/Mistakes/Inaccuracies:
The game ended in 4 moves, so I didn't have any time to make those.

Key Learning:
- Opening: Everyone seems to play the advanced variation, barely seen anyone play exchange or the Nc3 line. With the Nc3 line, you need to ensure that you capture on e4. With exchange you have the Panov attack or natural development.
- Middlegame: N/A
- Endgame: N/A

Key Takeaway: *Understanding why moves in the opening are played, helps aid my understanding and when I should follow theory or take a different path.*

## [NintailsChess (831) VS Djamel-Ouargla (857):](https://www.chess.com/analysis/library/tCgohRQMC/analysis)

Date: 04/08/25
Time Control: 15+10
Pieces: White
Opening: Italian Game vs St. George Defence
Result: Win (Due to resignation)

Critical Positions: (diagram or notation):


Blunders/Mistakes/Inaccuracies:
- 14. Nh4!?
	- Tactical error from me, black can take the d5 pawn and have a discovered attack on my knight, I'm not quite on that level yet, of looking for tactical opportunities that I could make for my opponents, that's very mentally taxing, but a next step forward.
- 16 g4
	- I'm starting to launch a scary attack on the kingside and black crumbles right away, it was a good idea to start pushing pawns forward and supporting my knight.

Key Learning:
- Opening: I played against an weird opening, that was extremely passive, best to just focus on natural development and not rush things.
- Middlegame: Look for tactics from the opponents perspective.
- Endgame: N/A

Key Takeaway: Develop pieces naturally, defend key pawns, be aware of opponents threats or potential threats.

## [NintailsChess (850) VS maut_ka_chumma (833)):](https://www.chess.com/analysis/library/28VL8hmpTG/)

Date: 06/08/25
Time Control: 15+10
Pieces: Black
Opening: Caro-Kann
Result: Win (Due to resignation)

Blunders/Mistakes/Inaccuracies:
- 7. Nc3!?
	- Taking a free pawn is simply better here, it also attacks a knight and develops a piece. hxg4.
- 10. Nd7!?
	- We must attack the key square of d4, this doesn't achieve this goal and gives white time to stem the bleeding.
- 17 g6??
	- The e-pawn is too weak and must be defended urgently or the king must be castled.

Key Learning:
- Opening: Be aware of hanging pieces.
- Middlegame: Keep an eye on key squares.
- Endgame: Very simple, as my opponent simply enabled me to trade down pieces.

Key Takeaway: Take hanging pieces if good, defend key pawns with pieces, get castled early.

## [NintailsChess (858) VS WojciechR1209 (860)):](https://www.chess.com/analysis/library/JZiAhF2LE/analysis)

Date: 04/08/25
Time Control: 15+10
Pieces: White
Opening: Italian Game - Modern Bishop's Opening
Result: Win (Due to resignation)

**One of my best games played so far. 96% accuracy across 36 moves.**

Critical Positions: (diagram or notation):
- 10. d4
	- I load up another attacker onto the pinned e-pawn and this strike in the centre proves deadly. As my opponent blunders his knight and I'm able to abuse the pin to prevent capture of my own knight.

I simply play very natural and principled chess.

Key Learning:
- Opening: Castling early is very strong in the Italian game.
- Middlegame: Punishing early queen aggression by developing with tempo is great.
- Endgame: A very solid endgame, you can practice conversion from move 18 against a hard CPU.

Key Takeaway: Playing simple natural chess, where you can simply keep attacking leads to an easy game.

## [NintailsChess (873) VS  ariful002 (801)](https://www.chess.com/analysis/library/c7N67viht/analysis)

Date: 08/09/2025
Time Control: 15 + 10
Pieces: Black
Opening: Caro-Kann Defence
Result: Win (Due to resignation)

Critical Positions: (diagram or notation):
- 10. f6!
	- Finding the pawn fork enables me to win a minor pieces after my opponent blunders, then the rest of the game is about converting down my advantage by trading pieces.
- 16 Bf5?
	- e4 is so much better, the principle behind this move - developing whilst attacking the queen is solid, but e4 forks his pieces again, and gives dominant centre control.

Key Learning:
- Opening: Try avoiding blocking your piece development with your pawns.
- Middlegame: Keep calm and keep spotting tactical ideas, considering what the opponent wants to do is great.
- Endgame: Even if you are up a million points, keep the endgame as airtight as you can.

Key Takeaway: Don't fear opponents attacks that are unsound, use defensive resources.

## [NintailsChess (867) VS  Razorfire2000 (955)](https://www.chess.com/analysis/library/25gTMWRN5c/analysis)

Date: 08/09/2025
Time Control: 15 + 10
Pieces: Black
Opening: Caro-Kann Defence
Result: Loss (Due to checkmate)

Critical Positions: (diagram or notation):
4. f3!?
	1. I did see my opponents idea of pushing his pawn, but I don't need to commit my attention to attacks that are bad or slow.
5. Qb6??
	1. I need to look for tactics and punish obvious forks. Before rushing and making a sub-optimal move.

The main idea is that since I had to route my knight and light bishop in the opening many times, I ended up in an awkward position since my pieces weren't developed quickly.

Also getting better at forking ideas OR defensive moves would of likely would of enabled me to win this game

Key Learning:
- Opening: Don't let your opponent fool you with nothing moves.
- Middlegame: Keep looking for tactics.
- Endgame: Trade pieces down ASAP in endgames or try to win material quickly. It's the simplest way to win the game, checkmating attacks are more elegant though.

Key Takeaway: 
Practice forks until they become more automatic, practice defensive ideas and tactics by playing against strong CPUs and thinking about pieces coordination, activity and key squares.

## [NintailsChess (877) VS BMR (949)](https://www.chess.com/analysis/library/3wF5Re9fhQ/analysis)

Date: 09/09/2025
Time Control: 15 + 10
Pieces: White
Opening: Scandinavian Defence
Result: Win (Due to checkmate)

Critical Positions: (diagram or notation):
- 6. d4?!
	- I miss the fact that black can play the combination of bxf3 on my knight and remove the defender of my pawn and discover an attack on my pawn.
- 12. Qa4+
	- This is a less accurate way of winning the game, you can develop your bishop freely, then take a minor pieces down the line. But just going for a simple fork works too.


Key Learning:
- Opening: If you encounter something unfamiliar basic principles still apply.
- Middlegame: Simple tactical combinations that are slightly less winning that ones that are complex are fine. But eventually, I'll only be getting more complex tactics, so it's good to practice them.
- Endgame: Think a little more about how to make passed pawns and promote.

Key Takeaway: Practice removing the defender/removing the guard and discoveries through chess tempo tactics.

## [NintailsChess (886) VS eelali (933)](https://www.chess.com/analysis/library/3f4GYzsEhk/analysis)

Date: 09/09/2025
Time Control: 15 + 10
Pieces: White
Opening: Italian Game
Result: Win (Due to checkmate)

Critical Positions: (diagram or notation):
- 6. c3?
	- It's much better to take the knight and force my opponent to create doubled pawns and weaken his king whilst it is in the centre. The learning point, is to think what happens when a capture or trade goes through. What resources have been created?
- 8. Be3?
	- We want to go with Qh5+ right away, since it's very forcing and causes my opponent to lose castling rights.



Key Learning:
- Opening: Thinking about captures and what structures change when they go through.
- Middlegame: Forcing moves above all, even if decent developing moves exist, you may not get another chance for purely winning moves.
- Endgame: N/A

Key Takeaway: Looking forward to seeing what happens after a capture occurs. Deflection tactics practice.

## [NintailsChess (894) VS spyccco (890)](https://www.chess.com/analysis/library/12gJCgVAs8/analysis)

Date: 09/09/2025
Time Control: 15 + 10
Pieces: Black
Opening: Caro-Kann Two knights attack
Result: Win (Due to resignation)

Critical Positions: (diagram or notation):
- 11. Ba6!
	- Finding the tactical idea and trading a bishop for a rook with the skewer on hitting the queen and rook was key.
- 16. Qxf3
	- There are sharper responses such as Nxf3+, but this option is good enough and allows for pieces to be traded down when we are already winning.


Key Learning:
- Opening: Using queens and kings in danger can create many tactical opportunities.
- Middlegame: Trading down pieces when ahead is a solid plan.
- Endgame: Activity on your rook is key in not only defending but attacking.

Key Takeaway: Following opening principles can lead to greater development, then tactical opportunities, that if pounced upon can result in a quick victory.

Date: 10/09/2025
Time Control: 15 + 10
Pieces: White
Opening: Scotch Game - Three Knights Opening
Result: Win (Due to resignation)

Critical Positions: 
3. Bc5?
	1. My opponent naturally develops a piece, but I have the move Nxe5! Which runs my opponent into a fork, and gives me a superior opening and my opponent must play accurately to stay somewhat even.
4. fxe3!?
	1. Slight inaccuracy from me, I did not see that my knight could take, this tunnel vision will come back to haunt me if not addressed.

Key Learning:
- Opening: Tactics can even occur early.
- Middlegame: Try to see the whole board and not tunnel vision.
- Endgame: Conversion against stockfish tells me that I understand ideas of how to win in a 2v1 rook endgame.

Key Takeaway: Being clinical after your opponent blunders is great practice.

## [NintailsChess (896) VS Wishiper96 (933)](https://www.chess.com/analysis/library/3aZPLzydnW/analysis)

Date: 10/09/2025
Time Control: 15 + 10
Pieces: Black
Opening: French Defence Exchange.
Result: Lost (Due to Checkmate)

Critical Positions: 
- 4. Nc3!?
	- Playing d4 and striking at the knight, with a more modern approach is simply better, the natural development here, ignores the resources that I have in the position.
- 9. Qxd5??
	- Very easy tactical idea, take the knight with check and queen hangs with Bxc3+
- 21 Ra6??
	- Keep track of particularly knights in the endgame, to prevent tactics.

Key Learning:
- Opening: Remember that you can break principles, if you 
- Middlegame: PRACTICE REMOVING THE DEFNEDER!!!
- Endgame: Keep eyes open for opponents tactics in the endgame, they can sneak a win if you miss something, just like what happened here.

Key Takeaway: I must practicing removing the defender tactics forever.

## [NintailsChess (904) VS juliocesar2025 (907)](https://www.chess.com/analysis/library/59cgkLWPhG/analysis)

Date: 10/09/2025
Time Control: 15 + 10
Pieces: White
Opening: Modern Defence, Against e4.
Result: Win (Due to checkmate)

Critical Positions: 
- 5. h3?!
	- We do not need to respond to this threat, we can simply continue to develop.
- 11. Bc4!
	- This starts a critical attack abusing the opponent queen and taking over the game. Critically, it also develops and strikes at another weakness, the f7 pawn.

Key Learning:
- Opening: Don't respond to nothing threats from the opponent.
- Middlegame: Practicing mates in 1, 2, and 3. Would enable me to be more confident and precise.
- Endgame: Look at overloading pieces that are pinned if you can.

Key Takeaway: Using the threat of checkmate to generate attacks is really powerful. I threatened checkmate once, my opponent blundered the defence and I won.
