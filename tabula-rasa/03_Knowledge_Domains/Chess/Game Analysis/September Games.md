# [NintailsChess (940) VS king00jin (898)](https://www.chess.com/analysis/library/4KAU9qLUTg/analysis)


Date: 1/09/25
Time Control: 15+10
Pieces: Black
Opening: London System
Result: Win
Moves: 36

Critical Positions: 

The main idea I missed was Qb6 in the position, because I was worried that my king would be under a big attack if I played that move.

Since I was able to play e4, I was able to lock white's pieces out of my kingside and start to move my own pieces over.

Key Learning:
- Opening: My development of minor pieces was good, and I was able to take control of the centre.
- Middlegame: Don't be afraid of king pawn structure, if the attack isn't realised.
- Endgame: Keep looking to simplify and trade down.

Key Takeaway: Not being afraid of pieces in front of my king or messing up my kings pawn structure, if no attack can actually occur. e.g. fearing ghosts.

Date: 1/09/25
Time Control: 15+10
Pieces: White
Opening: Stafford Gambit
Result: Win
Moves: 26

Critical Positions: 

- 6. h3
	- Thanks to me watching Eric Rozen, I know how to defend against the Stafford properly. You need to stop the knight swinging into g4.
- 12. a3?
	- This pawn move doesn't improve my position, it just kicks the queen, where as I can strike in the centre with d4 to prep e5 to launch a counter-attack. It is a slow move that doesn't help basically.
- 14. Nb1??
	- You have to take this pawn as your knight is a key defender of the centre, and black gains equality with proper play, it is good to recognise what threats are real and what threats are bogus.

Key Learning:
- Opening: Keep watching youtube videos of high level players.
- Middlegame: Try to keep the initiative after your defence works rather than keep giving the opponent chances to complicate.
- Endgame: Again, trading down and activating pieces results in a quick resignation.

Key Takeaway: Calculate what threats are real or not real, ignore unimportant threats and deal with important threats.

# [NintailsChess (958) VS EnzoLOR66 (1008)](https://www.chess.com/analysis/library/ur3twvRcz/analysis)


Date: 1/09/25
Time Control: 15+10
Pieces: Black
Opening: Caro-Kann Advanced
Result: Win
Moves: 28

Critical Positions: 
- 21 Rb8??
	- Blundering the f pawn, very important to consider opponents options and tactical ideas, even in the endgame.

Key Learning:
- Opening: The opening was solid, but development of pieces must be balanced with dealing with opponents threats.
- Middlegame: My opponent enabled me to trade down pieces into a winning endgame, so that was nice of him, relatively simple chess.
- Endgame: Never give up, if you can keep making threats your opponent can mess up.

Key Takeaway: A cheeky win, but won, because my opponent rushed, whilst I took my time.

# [NintailsChess (968) VS Mc-Fork (1042)](https://www.chess.com/analysis/library/39hVeqStDc/analysis)


Date: 3/09/25
Time Control: 15+10
Pieces: Black
Opening: QGD - Steinitz Countergambit
Result: Win
Moves: 28

Critical Positions: 

- 13 cxd4!
	- I'm able to take the pawn and win the following pawn exchange.
	- I should of taken with the knight, I was worried I'd hang my bishop, but it was OK since I attacked his queen at the same time, and would of been able to trade down bishops.

Key Learning:
- Opening: I played very sharp in the opening, abusing patterns that I've seen before with the queen coming to b6 to strike at both the bishop and pawn.
- Middlegame: I saw the key middlegame move but didn't execute it ideally.
- Endgame: I ran into time troubles and almost lost, but had a cheeky checkmate that helped me scrape a win, because my opponent got impatient and rushed when they had 5 minutes on the clock and I had 15 seconds.

Key Takeaway: I was winning, but in major time control issues, my opponent rushed and got mated. I believe that this is key, to not rush when you are ahead and winning. Impatience is really bad.

# [NintailsChess (976) VS Vladimir_0111 (975)](https://www.chess.com/analysis/library/2S5Eo3B5u8/analysis)


Date: 07/09/25
Time Control: 15+10
Pieces: Black
Opening: Transposition to an Italian System
Result: Win
Moves: 34

Critical Positions: 
- 11. b6
	- This was a key idea in the position, my bishop had no decent squares to develop to, so I was thinking of fianchettoing it, but then then ba6 ended up being a pivotal move.
- 16. Rad1? Nc4+??
	- I missed the tactical idea of trading down pieces, trading 1 rook for 2 bishops and a pawn is ideal, I just didn't calculate it.
- 19. Be6!
	- This move was key, threatening to take the rook by deflecting it's defensive of the bishop.

Key Learning:
- Opening: Opening moves weren't super sharp, but did make sense and contribute to a lead in the early game.
- Middlegame: Could of won earlier to a tactical idea: Remember if you can remove the key defender of a square, then tactics can open up.
- Endgame: Very solid endgame technique, of just trading down, not being afraid of being checked and infiltrating in the position.

Key Takeaway: Development of pieces is key, but if an idea permits you can go for it, especially if it is an attacking move.

# [NintailsChess (984) VS Scanzano (979)](https://www.chess.com/analysis/library/V3xdxtqCi/analysis)


Date: 07/09/25
Time Control: 15+10
Pieces: White
Opening: Queen's Gambit - Slav Gambit
Result: Win
Moves: 24

Critical Positions: 
This game was a tactical bulldoze against unsound play from my opponent. I would say that the calculation practice helped, but the instructive moments are limited.


Key Learning:
- Opening: Learning more theory in the Queen's Gambit is helpful here, to find a more crushing response to unsound play.
- Middlegame: I complicated the position and kept striking at his queen and used tactics to finish my opponent off.
- Endgame: N/A

Key Takeaway: Do not bring your queen out early like black did in this game. Especially multiple queen moves.

# [NintailsChess (992) VS Hunterahmed777 (972)](https://www.chess.com/analysis/library/2VdoodU8ni/analysis)


Date: 09/09/25
Time Control: 15+10
Pieces: White
Opening: Queen's Gambit
Result: Win
Moves: 26

Critical Positions: 
- 12. d5

Key Learning:
- Opening: I came out the opening better, because my opponent broke opening principles for no good initiative. 
- Middlegame: I setup a trap in the position as I wanted to deal with castling queenside and my opponent walked into it and lost immediately.
- Endgame: N/A

Key Takeaway: Breaking opening principles is bad, unless you have a concrete reason for doing so, also people below 1000 have no idea what they are doing in the Queen's Gambit.

Date: 09/09/25
Time Control: 15+10
Pieces: White
Opening: Caro Kann Exchange
Result: Loss
Moves: 19

Critical Positions: 
- 19. Rfe1??
	- I blundered my queen, not realising that the knight could move, checking my king and winning my Queen.

Key Learning:
- Opening: I played solid moves, but ended up on the back foot, due to striking in the centre without fulling developing first.
- Middlegame: I got distracted and excited by my pinning tactic that I overlooked a threat by my opponent.
- Endgame: N/A

Key Takeaway: Try to remain focussed and calm during the game, and ask myself, what is my opponents best move or response to this?
