# Great Players of the Past - Capablanca:

- He was born November 19th 1888 and died on March 8th 1942
- Alekhine beat Capablanca to become the world chess champion, then dodged him for the rest of his life until he died.
- He was world champion from 1921-1927
	- He beat Lasker, then lost to Alekhine. Though, Alekhine almost always lost in tournaments to Lasker or Capablanca.
- Alekhine was somewhat of an alcoholic, whilst Capablanca somewhat chased women, rather than playing chess.
- You can measure how successful someone is by the size of their Wikipedia page.

## Capablanca's Most Famous Game - 1918 New York Vs Marshall.

Frank Marshall apparently waited 10 years to uncork the Marshall Attack against Capablanca, then he refuted it on the spot.

- The game starts with the Spanish Game.
- The Marshall Attack occurs in the Ruy Lopez, when black sacrifices a pawn after castling. 
	- Capablanca knew he would have a great attack due to sacrificing the pawn.
- Many times Capablanca could of taken a piece, but it would of been losing, so he kept calmly defending, until he was up two minor pieces for a rook.
