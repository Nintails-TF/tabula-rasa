# BLUNDERS! Lecture with GM Ben Finegold

- Three kinds of pieces 
	- Pieces that are not attacked
	- Pieces that are attacked and not-defended. e.g. Hanging pieces
		- Take them for free.
	- Pieces that are attacked and defended
		- Most important kind!
- Most of what people say is wrong. Normally, you win at chess because you don't blunder and your opponent does.
	- Games are very close, then one person messes up big time and it's dead lost.
	- You don't win because one player does 20 bad moves, and another does 20 good moves. It's that people play in an even way, then blunder and one side wins.
- Don't resign.
	- Now, when GMs play against other GMs resigning has a purpose, but for average players, you shouldn't give up because you opponent can play like dog always.
	- You can consider resigning if: Your opponent has lots of time, they are high rated, and/or they have lots of pieces.
- When you win, lose or draw and the game is rated. Nobody cares about how you win the game, if you win the game.
	- **This means don't blunder. If your play is bad, but you don't blunder you are better than a player that does play well, but blunders.**
	- You build an amazing house, you plan on selling it for millions, then you say "Just one more nail" and the whole thing collapses, that is chess.
- It's equal, but I'd rather have this colour. This is because there are less traps and pitfalls for you to fall into!
- If you relax, you'll blunder and make a mistake.
	- You have to be locked in to actually play decent chess.
- Often we blunder because we see a threat, block it, but we didn't see the 2nd threat or other idea.
	- By avoiding blunders, you can beat players who are better than you.
	- Often higher rated players can be upset, because all it takes is one wrong move and a lower rated opponent can win.
