# Amortisation

**Tags:** #Accounting #DebtManagement #Assets #FinancialReporting

## Definition

The process of gradually reducing a debt through regular instalment payments, or spreading the cost of an intangible asset over its useful life for accounting purposes.

## Two Main Types

### 1. Loan Amortisation

Paying off a loan through scheduled payments that include both principal and interest.

**Example**: A £200,000 mortgage at 4% over 30 years has monthly payments of approximately £955. Early payments are mostly interest; later payments are mostly principal.

### 2. Asset Amortisation

Spreading the cost of an intangible asset (patents, copyrights, trademarks) over its useful life.

**Example**: A company purchases a patent for £100,000 with a 10-year useful life. Annual amortisation expense is £10,000.

Where:

- P = principal
- r = monthly interest rate
- n = number of payments
