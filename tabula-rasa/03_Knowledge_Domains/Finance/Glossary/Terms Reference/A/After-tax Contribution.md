# After-tax Contribution

**Tags:** #TaxPlanning #RetirementPlanning #Contributions #TaxStrategy

## Definition

Money contributed to an investment account, pension, or retirement vehicle (like a Roth IRA) that has already been subject to income tax.

## Key Characteristics

- **Taxed now**: Income tax paid before contribution
- **Tax-free growth**: Often grows tax-free
- **Tax-free withdrawal**: Qualified withdrawals typically tax-free
- **No immediate deduction**: Cannot reduce current taxable income

## Example

You earn £50,000 and pay £10,000 in taxes, leaving £40,000. If you contribute £5,000 to a Roth IRA, that's an after-tax contribution because you already paid taxes on that money.
