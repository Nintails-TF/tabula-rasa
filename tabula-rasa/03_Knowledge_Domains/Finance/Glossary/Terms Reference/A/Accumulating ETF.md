# Accumulating ETF

**Tags:** #ETF #DividendReinvestment #PassiveIncome #InvestmentVehicles

## Definition

An exchange-traded fund that automatically reinvests the dividends it earns back into the fund, rather than distributing them to investors.

## Key Characteristics

- **Automatic reinvestment**: No manual action required from investors
- **Compound growth**: Dividends contribute to long-term growth
- **Tax efficiency**: May defer tax obligations in some jurisdictions
- **Less control**: Investors cannot choose when to reinvest or use dividend income

## Example

If you hold an accumulating S&P 500 ETF that receives £1,000 in dividends from its holdings, that £1,000 is automatically used to purchase more shares of the underlying stocks, increasing the fund's total value without distributing cash to you.
