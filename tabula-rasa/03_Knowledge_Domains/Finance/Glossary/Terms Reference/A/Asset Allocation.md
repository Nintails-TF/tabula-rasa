# Asset Allocation

**Tags:** #PortfolioManagement #Diversification #RiskManagement #InvestmentStrategy

## Definition

An investment strategy that balances a portfolio across multiple asset classes (stocks, bonds, cash, real estate, commodities) to optimize the relationship between risk and return based on an investor's goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon.

## Major Asset Classes

- **Equities** (stocks): High risk, high potential return
- **Fixed Income** (bonds): Moderate risk, steady income
- **Cash/Cash Equivalents**: Low risk, low return, high liquidity
- **Real Estate**: Moderate-high risk, income + appreciation
- **Commodities**: High risk, inflation hedge
- **Alternative Investments**: Varies, low correlation to traditional assets

## Common Allocation Strategies

### Age-Based Rule of Thumb

**Bonds = Your Age**

- 30 years old: 30% bonds, 70% stocks
- 60 years old: 60% bonds, 40% stocks

### Risk-Based Models

- **Aggressive**: 90% stocks, 10% bonds
- **Moderate**: 60% stocks, 40% bonds
- **Conservative**: 30% stocks, 70% bonds

## Example

A 35-year-old investor with moderate risk tolerance might allocate:

- 60% stocks (40% domestic, 20% international)
- 30% bonds (20% government, 10% corporate)
- 5% real estate (REITs)
- 5% cash
