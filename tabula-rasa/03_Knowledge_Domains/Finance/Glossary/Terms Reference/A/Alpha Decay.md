# Alpha Decay

**Tags:** #Performance #InvestmentStrategy #MarketEfficiency #TradingStrategy

## Definition

The gradual erosion or degradation of an investment strategy's excess returns (alpha) over time, typically due to market adaptation, increased competition, or changing market conditions.

## Common Causes

- **Market efficiency**: More traders discover and exploit the same opportunity
- **Competition**: Other funds adopt similar strategies
- **Market evolution**: Market structure or behaviour changes
- **Technology**: Algorithms and high-frequency trading reduce opportunities
- **Capacity constraints**: Strategy becomes less effective at larger scale

## Example

A quantitative trading strategy that generates 5% alpha in year one might only generate 3% in year two and 1% in year three as other traders identify and exploit the same market inefficiency, eliminating the edge.
