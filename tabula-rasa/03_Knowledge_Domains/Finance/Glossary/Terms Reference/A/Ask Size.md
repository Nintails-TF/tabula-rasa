# Ask Size

**Tags:** #Trading #OrderBook #MarketDepth #Liquidity

## Definition

The quantity of shares or units that sellers are willing to sell at the current ask price. It indicates the depth of supply available at that specific price level.

## How to Read

Quote shows: **Ask £50.00 × 500**

- Ask price: £50.00
- Ask size: 500 shares available

This means you can buy up to 500 shares at £50.00. For more shares, you'd pay a higher price.

## Example

Order book displays:

- Ask: £50.00 × 500 shares
- Ask: £50.05 × 1,000 shares
- Ask: £50.10 × 2,500 shares

You can buy:

- Up to 500 shares @ £50.00
- 501-1,500 shares @ £50.05
- 1,501-4,000 shares @ £50.10
