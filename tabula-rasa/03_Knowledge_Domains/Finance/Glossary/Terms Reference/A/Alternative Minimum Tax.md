# Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT)

**Tags:** #Taxation #TaxPlanning #TaxCode #PersonalFinance

## Definition

A parallel tax system in the United States designed to ensure that individuals and corporations with substantial deductions, credits, or certain types of income still pay a minimum amount of federal income tax.

## How It Works

1. Calculate regular tax liability
2. Calculate AMT liability (using different rules)
3. Pay the higher of the two amounts

## Who Gets Affected

- High earners with many deductions
- Those exercising [[Incentive Stock Options (ISOs)]]
- People with significant state/local tax deductions
- Those with large capital gains

## Example

An individual claims £100,000 in deductions under regular tax law, resulting in £20,000 tax owed. Under AMT rules, some deductions are disallowed, resulting in £30,000 owed. They must pay the higher AMT amount of £30,000.
