# Ask Price

**Tags:** #Trading #OrderBook #MarketMicrostructure #Pricing

## Definition

The minimum price at which a seller (market maker or investor) is willing to sell a security in the market. It represents the "offer" side of a quote.

## Key Characteristics

- Always higher than the [[Bid Price]]
- Part of the bid-ask quote
- Changes dynamically based on supply/demand
- Represents the cost to buy immediately

## Example

A stock quote shows:

- Bid: £49.95
- Ask: £50.00

If you want to buy shares immediately, you pay £50.00 (the ask price). The £0.05 difference is the [[Bid-Ask Spread]].
