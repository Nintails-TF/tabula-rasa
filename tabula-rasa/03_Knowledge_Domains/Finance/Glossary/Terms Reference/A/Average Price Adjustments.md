# Average Price Adjustments

**Tags:** #Trading #CostBasis #PositionManagement #InvestmentStrategy

## Definition

A method of modifying the average purchase price of securities in a portfolio by buying additional shares at different prices, typically to lower the overall cost basis when prices decline (averaging down) or building positions gradually.

## Types

### 1. Averaging Down

Buying more shares when price drops to lower average cost

**Example:**

- Buy 100 shares @ £50 = £5,000
- Price drops to £40
- Buy 100 more shares @ £40 = £4,000
- **New average: £45** (£9,000 / 200 shares)

### 2. Averaging Up

Buying more shares as price rises during an uptrend

**Example:**

- Buy 100 shares @ £50 = £5,000
- Price rises to £60
- Buy 50 more shares @ £60 = £3,000
- **New average: £53.33** (£8,000 / 150 shares)

## Formula

**Average Price = (Total Amount Spent) / (Total Shares Owned)**

Or:

**New Average = [(Shares₁ × Price₁) + (Shares₂ × Price₂)] / (Shares₁ + Shares₂)**
