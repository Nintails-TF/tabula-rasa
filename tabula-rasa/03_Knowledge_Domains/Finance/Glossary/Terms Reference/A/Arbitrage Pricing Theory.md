# Arbitrage Pricing Theory (APT)

**Tags:** #AssetPricing #FinancialModels #Valuation #RiskFactors

## Definition

A multi-factor asset pricing model used to estimate the fair value of a security by considering multiple macroeconomic and company-specific factors that affect risk and expected return, as an alternative to the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM).

## Key Principles

- Expected returns depend on multiple risk factors
- More flexible than CAPM's single-factor (market) approach
- Based on no-arbitrage assumption
- Linear relationship between factors and returns

## Formula

**Expected Return = Risk-free Rate + β₁(Factor 1) + β₂(Factor 2) + ... + βₙ(Factor n)**

## Common Factors

- **Macroeconomic**: Inflation, interest rates, GDP growth, exchange rates
- **Market-related**: Market risk premium, sector performance
- **Company-specific**: Size, value, momentum, quality

## Example

A stock's expected return might be modeled as:

Expected Return = 3% (risk-free) + 0.8(market risk) + 0.5(inflation risk) + 0.3(interest rate risk)

## APT Vs CAPM

|APT|CAPM|
|---|---|
|Multiple factors|Single factor (market)|
|More flexible|Simpler|
|Better real-world fit|Easier to implement|
|Factors not specified|Market clearly defined|

## Advantages

- More realistic than single-factor models
- Can identify specific risk exposures
- Flexible factor selection

## Disadvantages

- Requires identifying relevant factors
- More complex to implement
- Factor selection can be subjective
