# Award Price

**Tags:** #EmployeeCompensation #StockOptions #EquityCompensation #ExercisePrice

## Definition

The predetermined price at which an employee can purchase company stock through stock options or equity awards, typically set at the fair market value on the grant date. Also known as exercise price, strike price, or grant price.

## How It Works

1. Company grants stock options
2. Award price is set (usually current market price)
3. Employee waits for vesting
4. If stock price rises above award price, employee profits
5. Employee exercises options at award price
6. Can sell at current market price for profit

## Example

- **Award Date**: January 1, 2024
- **Award Price**: £50 per share
- **Options Granted**: 1,000 shares
- **Vesting**: 4 years

After 4 years (2028):

- Current stock price: £80
- Employee exercises at £50 (award price)
- Cost: £50,000
- Immediate value: £80,000
- **Profit: £30,000** (before taxes)

- [[Fair Market Value]]

## Types of Pricing

### At-the-Money

Award price = current stock price (most common)

### In-the-Money

Award price < current stock price (immediate value)

### Out-of-the-Money

Award price > current stock price (no intrinsic value yet)

## Tax Implications

- **ISOs**: Favorable tax treatment if requirements met
- **NSOs**: Taxed as ordinary income on spread at exercise
- [[Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT)]] may apply to ISOs

## Important Factors

- Award price is fixed at grant
- Profit potential if stock appreciates
- No obligation to exercise
- Options can expire worthless if stock price stays below award price
- Usually set at fair market value to comply with tax law

## Decision Factors for Exercise

✅ Stock price significantly above award price ✅ Sufficient cash to purchase ✅ Diversification considerations ✅ Tax planning strategy ✅ Belief in company's future

❌ Stock price near or below award price ❌ Short time until expiration ❌ Lack of liquidity to exercise ❌ Need for diversification
