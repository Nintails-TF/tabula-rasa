# Aggregating Mode

**Tags:** #Trading #PositionManagement #TradingPlatform #AveragePrice

## Definition

A position management method where you hold only a single open position for a given instrument. When opening additional positions in the same direction, they combine with the existing position and the entry price is averaged across all holdings.

## How It Works

The weighted average formula calculates the new average price:

**New Average Price = (Position₁ × Price₁ + Position₂ × Price₂) / (Position₁ + Position₂)**

## Example

1. You buy 10 shares at £50 = £500 total
2. You buy 5 more shares at £60 = £300 total
3. Your position: 15 shares at £53.33 average price (£800 / 15)
