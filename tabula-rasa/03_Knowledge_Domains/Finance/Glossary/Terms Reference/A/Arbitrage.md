# Arbitrage

**Tags:** #TradingStrategy #MarketEfficiency #Pricing #RiskFree

## Definition

The simultaneous buying and selling of an asset in different markets to profit from price discrepancies, exploiting temporary market inefficiencies for risk-free profit.

## How It Works

1. Identify price difference for same asset in different markets
2. Buy in the cheaper market
3. Sell in the more expensive market
4. Profit from the spread (minus transaction costs)

## Example

- NASDAQ sells stock XYZ for £50
- London Stock Exchange sells same stock for £51
- Buy 1,000 shares on NASDAQ for £50,000
- Simultaneously sell on LSE for £51,000
- **Profit: £1,000** (before transaction costs)

## Types of Arbitrage

- **Spatial arbitrage**: Price differences across exchanges
- **Temporal arbitrage**: Price differences over time
- **Statistical arbitrage**: Exploiting historical price relationships
- **Triangular arbitrage**: Currency exchange rate differences
- **Merger arbitrage**: Exploiting acquisition announcement prices
