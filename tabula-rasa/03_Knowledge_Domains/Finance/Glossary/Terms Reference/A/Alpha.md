# Alpha

**Tags:** #Performance #InvestmentMetrics #RiskAdjustedReturn #Benchmark

## Definition

A measure of an investment's performance relative to a market index or benchmark, indicating whether it has over or underperformed on a risk-adjusted basis. Alpha represents the excess return beyond what would be expected from market movements alone.

## Interpretation

- **Positive alpha**: Investment outperformed the benchmark
- **Zero alpha**: Performance matched the benchmark
- **Negative alpha**: Investment underperformed the benchmark

## Formula

**Alpha = Actual Return - Expected Return (based on Beta and market return)**

## Example

A mutual fund returns 12% in a year when its benchmark index returned 10%. The fund has an alpha of +2%, meaning it outperformed by 2%, suggesting skilled management or favourable security selection.
