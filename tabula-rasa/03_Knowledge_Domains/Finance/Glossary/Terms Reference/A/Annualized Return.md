# Annualized Return

**Tags:** #Performance #InvestmentMetrics #Returns #CompoundGrowth

## Definition

A calculated metric that shows the average annual rate of return for an investment over a specific period, accounting for compounding. It standardizes returns of different time periods for comparison.

## Formula

**Annualized Return = [(Ending Value / Beginning Value)^(1/n)] - 1**

Where n = number of years

## Example

An investment grows from £1,000 to £1,210 over two years.

Calculation:

- (£1,210 / £1,000)^(1/2) - 1
- (1.21)^0.5 - 1
- 1.10 - 1
- **0.10 or 10% annualized return**

This means the investment grew at an average of 10% per year.

## Related Concepts

- [[Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR)]]
- [[Total Return]]
- [[Time-weighted Return]]
- [[Internal Rate of Return (IRR)]]
- [[Geometric Mean]]

## Why It Matters

- Allows comparison across different time periods
- More accurate than simple average return
- Accounts for compounding effects
- Standard metric for performance reporting

## Important Note

Annualized returns assume steady growth, but actual year-to-year returns may vary significantly.
