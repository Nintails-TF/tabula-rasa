# Active Management

**Tags:** #InvestmentStrategy #PortfolioManagement #FundManagement #Performance

## Definition

An investment approach where portfolio managers actively make buy and sell decisions to outperform a specific benchmark or market index, rather than simply replicating it.

## Key Characteristics

- **Goal**: Beat the market or benchmark index
- **Approach**: Research-driven security selection and market timing
- **Costs**: Higher fees due to research and trading
- **Risk**: May underperform if decisions are poor

## Example

A fund manager actively managing a portfolio might decide to overweight technology stocks and underweight energy stocks based on economic analysis, attempting to beat the S&P 500 return of 10% by achieving 12%.
