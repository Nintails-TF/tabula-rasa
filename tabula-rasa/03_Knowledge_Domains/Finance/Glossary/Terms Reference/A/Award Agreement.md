## Key Components

- Grant date
- Award type (stock options, RSUs, PSUs, etc.)
- Exercise price (for options)

### Vesting Schedule

- Time-based vesting (e.g., 4 years, 25% per year)
- Performance-based vesting conditions
- Cliff periods
- Acceleration triggers

### Terms & Conditions

- Expiration date
- Exercise window
- Post-termination treatment
- Change of control provisions
- Tax implications
- Non-compete or other restrictive covenants

## Example Vesting Schedule

**4-Year Vest with 1-Year Cliff**

- Year 0-1: 0% vested (cliff period)

- **Tax implications**: May owe taxes at vest or exercise
- **Post-termination**: Limited time to exercise after leaving
- **Documentation**: Keep all award agreements safe

## Common Award Types

- **Stock Options**: Right to buy at set price
- **RSUs**: Actual shares granted upon vesting
- **PSUs**: Shares contingent on performance metrics
- **Phantom Stock**: Cash equivalent to stock value
