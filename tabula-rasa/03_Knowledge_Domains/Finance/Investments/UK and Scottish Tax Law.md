# Tax-Efficient Strategies (Scotland)

## **Tax-Free Allowances (Use Them or Lose Them Each Year)**

- **Personal Allowance:** £12,570 income tax-free
    - Your salary money before income tax kicks in.
    - Reduced by £1 for every £2 earned over £100,000.
- **ISAs:** £20,000/year completely tax-free
    - 20k contribution per tax year max. Can be cash/stocks and shares/lifetime, etc.
- **Lifetime ISA:** £4,000/year (counts toward ISA limit), 25% government bonus for first home/retirement
- **Capital Gains Tax Allowance:** £3,000 CGT-free
    - The money from gains that you can withdraw from a Non-ISA stocks and shares account.
    - Example: Buy £10k of shares, sell for £15k.
        - £3k tax free, CGT on £2k
    - **Bed and ISA strategies**
        - Sell shares in taxable account using your £3k allowance.
        - Buy the same shares in the ISA right away.
        - Move your taxable holdings into the tax-free stocks and shares ISA.
        - Warning: Price can change between sell and buy.
- **Dividend Allowance:** £500 dividend tax-free
    - The money from dividends that you get tax free.
- **Personal Savings Allowance:** £1,000 interest tax-free (basic rate) / £500 (higher rate)
    - At 1.2% interest this would be savings of £83,333 at the basic rate, or £41,667 at the higher rate.
- **Marriage Allowance:** Transfer £1,260 of unused personal allowance to spouse
    - Spousal CGT transfers are to be considered as well.
- **Junior ISA**
    - £9k yearly limit if you have kids.
- **Trading Allowance:** £1,000 tax-free from self-employment/casual income
    - You don't have to declare this if under £1k.
    - If over £1k:
        - Use the £1k allowance
        - Or deduct business costs if more profitable
            - Pay tax on profit after expenses. e.g. Earn £3k, £1.5k business expenses → £1.5k taxable income.

**Important:** Dividends and savings interest use UK-wide rates (not Scottish rates).

# Pensions:

All pensions are locked until age 55 (rising to 57 in 2028), unless laws change. Yearly pension contributions cannot be more than £60k with all pensions combined.

You can contribute more than £60k by using unused allowances from the previous 3 tax years. Example: only deposit £20k year 1, you can do £100k year 2.

- **Self-Invested Personal Pension (SIPP)**
    - Choose your investments.
    - Like ISA but with pension tax breaks.
    - You contribute from post-tax income, but get tax relief.
- **Workplace Pensions**
    - Employer contributions
        - Public sector generally gives better pension rates, certain contracts do as well.
        - Always match employer contributions - free money from employer.
    - Saves National Insurance (both employee and employer NI)
    - Max this out first, as it gives the highest saving rate.
- **Personal Pensions**
    - Managed by a provider.

## **Tax Relief Rates (Scottish Bands)**

Your tax relief depends on your marginal rate:

- **Starter rate (£12,571-£15,397): 19% relief**
    - £100 contribution costs you £81
- **Basic rate (£15,398-£27,491): 20% relief**
    - £100 contribution costs you £80
- **Intermediate rate (£27,492-£43,662): 21% relief**
    - £100 contribution costs you £79
- **Higher rate (£43,663-£75,000): 42% relief**
    - £100 contribution costs you £58
- **Advanced rate (£75,001-£125,140): 45% relief**
    - £100 contribution costs you £55
- **Top rate (£125,140+): 48% relief**
    - £100 contribution costs you £52

Pension withdrawal strategies exist. Taking a lump sum can cause your pension to fall into lower tax brackets.

## **Investment Schemes:**

Tax breaks for investing in UK companies. Only really good if you're already wealthy, as they are risky.

- **VCT (Venture Capital Trust):** 30% income tax relief upfront, tax-free dividends/gains
    - £200k limit each tax year
    - Portfolio of start-ups, small and growth companies in the UK.
- **EIS (Enterprise Investment Scheme):** 30% income tax relief, CGT-free after 3 years
    - Similar to VCT, but higher risk as you invest in single companies.
    - £1M limit. Tax-free capital gains after 3 years. Can defer CGT by re-investing into EIS.
    - If company fails, you can offset losses against income tax.
        - Recover up to 48% (at top rate).
- **SEIS (Seed EIS):** 50% income tax relief
    - £200k limit per tax year
    - EIS but even riskier - companies in first 2 years of trading.
    - Tax-free capital gains after 3 years.
    - Loss relief as well.

## **Spousal Strategies**

- **Transfer assets to spouse** in lower tax bracket to use their allowances
- **Joint ownership** of investments to split income

## **Other Methods**

- **Pension salary sacrifice:** Reduce taxable income, increase pension, save NI
- **Premium Bonds:** Prizes are tax-free (luck-based)
- **Rent-a-room relief:** £7,500 tax-free if you rent out a room in your home
- **Charitable donations (Gift Aid):** Get tax relief on donations
- **Offset capital gains with losses:** Harvest losses to reduce CGT
    - Sell losing investments before the tax year ends. Offset your gains with losses.
    - Buy back after 30 days to avoid "bed and breakfasting" rule.
    - Reduce your capital gains tax. Useful if you do a lot of trading.

All other niche strategies like AIM ISAs, Business Relief, Entrepreneurs Relief require significantly more capital.
