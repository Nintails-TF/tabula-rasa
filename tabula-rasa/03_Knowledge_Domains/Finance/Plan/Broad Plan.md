# Markets to Invest In:

## Defence 🎯

**Why it works:** European defence budgets projected to grow 6.8% annually through 2035, with spending rising from 2.4% to 3.2-3.5% of GDP by 2030—adding $200-300 billion in new spending. This isn't political speculation; governments have already committed funds. Companies report record backlogs (Rheinmetall: €62.6B) and multi-year visibility. Ukraine war + US unreliability = structural, decade-long spending cycle regardless of election outcomes.

War and conflict are on peoples horizon at the moment, along with the potential of Nationalist right-wing leaders being elected into government, who love civic participation and military spending.

**Risk:** Many stocks already up 100-200%+. Some investor impatience emerging.

## Cybersecurity 🔒

**Why it works:** EU's NIS2 Directive forces 160,000+ entities into mandatory compliance by 2026, with penalties up to €10M or 2% of global turnover. Not optional—it's regulatory. Average security spending jumping to 9% of IT budgets, creating forced demand. Global cybersecurity spending projected to grow from $196B (2025) to $262B (2030). Spending is non-discretionary and recession-resistant.

More information and data going online - particularly biometric data, personal, details. Cybersecurity will rise eventually, especially in response to turbulence.

**Edge:** Near-term catalyst (2026) vs. vague political outcomes in 2027-2029.

## Automation/Robotics 🤖

**Why it works:** European industrial robots market growing 9.5% CAGR, from $4.6B (2024) to $36.8B (2033). Collaborative robots (cobots) demand growing 11.2% in Europe as costs fall and AI integration makes them smarter. Works whether populists win or lose—demographic reality drives adoption.

**Labour shortages + anti-immigration policies + aging populations** = Make machines do more of the heavy lifting.

**Sweet spot:** Europe's Industry 4.0 + reshoring manufacturing trends already underway.

## Energy ⚡

**Why it works:** EU committed to $750B in US LNG/oil/nuclear purchases through 2028 to replace Russian supplies. Energy security is now strategic priority. Nuclear generation forecast to hit all-time high in 2025 as Europe restarts reactors and builds new capacity. European energy majors offer 6-13% dividend yields while trading at 20-39% below fair value. You get paid to wait.

AI and ChatGPT accelerate the demand for energy as well, if more infrastructure is being built - more energy is needed to reply.

**Bonus:** Traditional energy benefits from populist scepticism of rapid green transitions while still participating in nuclear/LNG growth.

# Consulting & Professional Services:

**Turbulence creates three types of billable work:**
1. **Policy Translation** - New regulations every 2-4 years = companies need help adapting
2. **Political Cover** - Executives hire consultants to justify unpopular decisions
3. **Complexity Navigation** - More rules, more stakeholders, more confusion = more fees

If policies and laws change or if companies need to change, then consulting firms will be brought in to make hard decisions for a these companies if the leaders can't do them or can't get permissions from a board to do them.
