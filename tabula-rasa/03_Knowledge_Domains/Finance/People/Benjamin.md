# Theory from the Funniest Guy in Finance:

**Edges:**
The idea of generating value from the market is finding an edge from opinions that people see as being immutable. e.g. Nobody thought that GameStop was worth shit, then social media hysteria made it an insane opportunity. The housing market can't crash it's too stable, etc.

It wasn't that GameStop magically gained value, declining brick-and-mortar retail and the physical copy of video games have and still are losing value. It was that the stock was heavily short-squeezed and market mechanics enabled people to have a nice holiday in the Bahamas, or a Remington 870 pointed at their head.

The core principle: "Be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful rings true." Value investing and beating the market comes from better analysis and understanding problems which are real or temporary and looking at what others miss.

**Options:**
Options are either puts or calls. Line go up by certain date or line go down by certain date. The appeal of options is that they provide leverage. 1 contract can be used to expose a person to the market with many more shares at the fraction of the price.

e.g. Gains and Losses are amplified and have other risk exposures like volatility.

In the real word, e.g. not retail investing. People use options to hedge against risk. If you own a company and buy puts against it, your share value will decrease, but you put value will offset the loss.

Where do options come from - well the **options market**. These options market SHOULD function as a rational exchange between informed buyers and sellers. Assuming that most actors are making rational, price informed, decisions, based on available information.

No fancy strategy will make money in the long term if the option price is fair, which most of the time it is.

Using Implied volatility to figure out what options are cheap vs expensive are key to actually making money.
