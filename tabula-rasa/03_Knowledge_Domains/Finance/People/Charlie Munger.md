# Charlie Munger

> *The first 100k, is a bitch, but you gotta do it. I don't care what you have to do, if it means walking everywhere and not eating anything that wasn't purchased with a coupon, find a way to get your hands on 100k.*

## Story:
## Characteristics:

- Blend of honesty, humour, and kindness with pragmatism.
- He understands that certain people are a lost cause, and you don't invest your resources into them.
- Integrity and reputation are a resource. Philosophically, he agrees with playing fair, but it also serves a financial reason too - you build long term clients and relationships, and then people talk about how you are the best and what you do and aren't a dick.
- Never spend your money on junk.
## Quotes:

> *"Some people wear signs saying: Danger. Danger. Do not touch. Yet people charge right ahead, yet that is a mistake".[^1]*

> "*Perhaps the best musician to ever live - Mozart, died young and bitterly unhappy. He did two things that are guaranteed to create a lot of misery.*
> 
> *1. He overspent his income scrupulously.*
> *2. He was full of jealousy and resentment."[^1]*

> *"The truth of the matter is that not everyone can learn everything. Some people are way the hell better, no matter how hard you try, there is always some guy or gal that achieves more. And my attitude is so what?"[^1]*

> *"It's a game of being there all the time and recognizing the rare opportunity when it comes. The normal human allotment is to not have very many."[^1]*

> *"The secret was this business of controlling the costs and living simply... if you live long enough, you end up rich"[^1]*

> *"It isn't that we were so good at doing things that were difficult. We were good at avoiding things that were difficult and finding things that are easy."[^1]*

> *"If we were selling horseshit we didn't pretend it was the cure to arthritis."[^2]*

> *There are just so many people that should be avoided.[^2]*

> *Peter Kaufman is always telling me: "If the crooks only knew how much money they could make by being honest."[^2]*

> *If you take the high road - it's never crowded - and it's worked.[^2]*

> *It's really stupid when you're already rich to get the reputation of being a total nogoodnik[^2]*

> *The world is not driven by greed, but by envy. We take our situation for granted and we want more than the other person across from us. It's not fair that he has it and I don't.[^3]*

> *I can't change the fact that a lot of people are very unhappy and feel very abused after everything has improved by about 600%.[^3]*

> *Who in the hell needs a Rolex watch so you can get mugged for it? Yet everyone wants to have a pretentious expenditure, that drives demand and generates revenue in our capitalist society. My advice to young people, to hell with it, don't go over there.[^3]*

> *If you have good judgement your life will work a lot better than if you have bad judgement. You get good judgement gradually over time, by making bad judgements.[^4]*

> *My counsel has always been to start trying to be better and keep doing - keep trying to improve all your life, and you got about half a chance, if you don't do that then you got no chance.[^4]*

> *I would teach those who could learn, and the others that couldn't keep up, the hell with them. What can't be improved, can't be improved. That's how academia works, they throw the people out who can't keep up[^4]*

> *The secret is the reason why they turn out so well, is that they take in such good people. They can't fix the clods. Nobody can, dumb is forever.[^4]*
