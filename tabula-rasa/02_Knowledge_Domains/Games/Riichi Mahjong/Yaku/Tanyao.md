# Tanyao (断幺九)

**English:** All Simples  
**Han:** 1 (closed or open*)  
**Frequency:** Very common

> *Open tanyao (kuitan) validity depends on ruleset. Most online platforms and modern rules allow it; some traditional rulesets do not.

---

## Overview

Tanyao means "cut off terminals and honours." Your entire hand uses only simple tiles—the 2 through 8 of each suit. No 1s, no 9s, no winds, no dragons.

It's one of the easiest yaku to understand and one of the most versatile to build. Tanyao combines with almost everything and can be played fast (open) or strong (closed with riichi).

---

## Requirements

|Condition|Explanation|
|---|---|
|**Simples only**|Every tile must be 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8|
|**No terminals**|No 1s or 9s in any suit|
|**No honours**|No winds (East, South, West, North) or dragons (Haku, Hatsu, Chun)|
|**Any structure**|Sequences, triplets, pairs—all valid as long as tiles are simples|

That's it. One simple rule applied to every tile in your hand.

---

## Valid Tiles

```
Manzu (characters): 2m 3m 4m 5m 6m 7m 8m
Pinzu (circles):    2p 3p 4p 5p 6p 7p 8p
Souzu (bamboo):     2s 3s 4s 5s 6s 7s 8s
```

**Total:** 21 tile types (7 per suit × 3 suits)

---

## Example Hands

### Basic Tanyao

```
234m 567m 345p 678s 55p
```

All simples, clean and straightforward.

### Tanyao with Triplets

```
222m 345p 666s 78s 55p
Waiting: 6s
```
### Open Tanyao (Kuitan)

```
[234m chi] [567p chi] 345s 88s + 46s
Waiting: 5s
```

Two calls made, hand is open. Still valid for tanyao in most rulesets.

### Tanyao + Toitoi

```
222m 444p 666p 888s 55s
```

All triplets, all simples. Tanyao (1) + Toitoi (2) = 3 han.

## What Disqualifies Tanyao

Even a single terminal or honour tile breaks tanyao:

- **One 1 or 9** — e.g. 123m contains a 1m, no tanyao
- **Any honour** — e.g. pair of East, no tanyao
- **Waiting on terminal** — e.g. 789 shape waiting on 7 or 9; winning on 9 breaks tanyao

## Common Combinations

|Combo|Han|Notes|
|---|---|---|
|Tanyao + Riichi|2|Standard closed hand|
|Tanyao + Pinfu|2|Natural pairing, sequences of simples|
|Tanyao + Riichi + Pinfu|3|Bread-and-butter hand|
|Tanyao + Pinfu + Iipeikou|3|e.g. 234m 234m 567p 345s 66s|
|Tanyao + Toitoi|3|All triplets of simples|
|Tanyao + Sanankou|3|Three concealed triplets of simples|
|Tanyao + Chinitsu|7|One suit, all simples (2-8 only)|
|Tanyao + Chiitoitsu|3|Seven pairs, all simples|

Tanyao cannot combine with:

- [[Chanta]] / [[Junchan]] (requires terminals)
- [[Honroutou]] (requires terminals and honours)
- [[Kokushi Musou]] (requires all terminals and honours)
- Any yakuhai (dragons/winds are honours)

## Strategy Tips

### Building Toward Tanyao

1. **Discard terminals and honours early** — 1s, 9s, and honours can't contribute
2. **Keep flexible middle shapes** — 35, 46, 57 can all become sequences
3. **Pair on simples** — Avoid pairing on terminals; you'll want that pair for tanyao

### Open Vs Closed Tanyao

**Open (kuitan):**
- Fast, cheap, but only 1 han
- Use when you need to win quickly (e.g. avoiding someone else's riichi)
- Good for defence—get to tenpai fast, then fold if needed
- Loses riichi, pinfu, iipeikou potential

**Closed:**
- Combines with riichi (+1), pinfu (+1), iipeikou (+1)
- Higher scoring but slower
- Better when you have good shape already

### When to Abandon Tanyao
- You draw honour triplets worth more value (yakuhai, shousangen potential)
- Honitsu or Chinatsu becomes viable with terminals
- You need a specific terminal to complete a higher-value hand
- Defence requires holding safe terminals

### Tile Efficiency Note
Tanyao hands use the most "central" tiles—the ones with maximum connectivity. 4, 5, 6 connect to the most sequences. This means tanyao hands often have good shape naturally. If your tanyao hand has bad shape, reconsider whether you're holding the right tiles.

## Kuitan (Open Tanyao) Rule Variations

|Ruleset|Kuitan Allowed?|
|---|---|
|Tenhou / Mahjong Soul|Yes (default)|
|WRC (World Riichi Championship)|Yes|
|EMA (European Mahjong Association)|Yes|
|JPML (some rules)|No|
|Some traditional Japanese clubs|No|

Always confirm before playing. If kuitan is off, you must keep your hand closed for tanyao.

## Comparison with Similar Yaku

|Yaku|Restriction|Han|
|---|---|---|
|**Tanyao**|No terminals, no honours|1|
|[[Chanta]]|Every group has terminal OR honour|2/1|
|[[Junchan]]|Every group has terminal (no honours)|3/2|
|[[Honroutou]]|ONLY terminals and honours|2|

Tanyao is the opposite of chanta/junchan/honroutou—it excludes what they require.

## Related Yaku

- [[Pinfu]] — Classic pairing, all sequences of simples
- [[Iipeikou]] — Identical sequences, easy in simples
- [[Chiitoitsu]] — Seven pairs of simples
- [[Toitoi]] — All triplets of simples
- [[Chinitsu]] — Single suit, can be all simples (rare but high value)

---

## Summary

Tanyao is the workhorse yaku. Easy to understand, flexible to build, and combines with almost everything. It's equally valid as a quick 1-han escape or as the foundation of a 5+ han hand.

The skill in tanyao isn't recognising it—it's deciding when to commit to it versus pivoting to something else, and whether to open for speed or stay closed for value.

Simple tiles, complex decisions.
