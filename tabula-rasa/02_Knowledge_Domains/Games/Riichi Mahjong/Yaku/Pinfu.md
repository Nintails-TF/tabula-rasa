# Pinfu (平和)

**English:** All Sequences / No Points  
**Han:** 1 (closed only) 
**Frequency:** Very common

---

## Overview

Pinfu literally means "flat/peaceful hand" or "no points hand." It's defined by scoring zero fu (minipoints) from your hand's composition. This makes it unique among yaku—you qualify by avoiding point-scoring elements rather than including specific tiles.

Despite being only 1 han, pinfu is foundational. It teaches efficient shape-building and rewards the flexible, two-sided waits that define strong play.

---

## Requirements

All five conditions must be met:

|Condition|Explanation|
|---|---|
|**Closed hand**|No chi, pon, or kan calls|
|**Four sequences**|All four groups are runs (123, 234, 567, etc.)|
|**Valueless pair**|Pair cannot be dragons, seat wind, or round wind|
|**Two-sided wait**|Must win on ryanmen (open-ended wait)|
|**Win by any method**|Ron or tsumo both valid|

---

## What Disqualifies Pinfu

- **Any triplet** — Even one triplet breaks the "all sequences" rule
- **Yakuhai pair** — Dragons (haku, hatsu, chun), your seat wind, or round wind
- **Kanchan wait** — Middle wait (e.g. 35 waiting on 4)
- **Penchan wait** — Edge wait (e.g. 12 waiting on 3, or 89 waiting on 7)
- **Tanki wait** — Pair wait (e.g. waiting on a single tile to complete the pair)
- **Shanpon wait** — Dual triplet wait (e.g. 55 77 waiting on 5 or 7)

---

## Example Hands

### Valid Pinfu

```
123m 456m 234p 678s 55p
Waiting: 3-6s (ryanmen to complete 345s or 678s shape)
```

- Four sequences ✓
- Pair of 5p (not yakuhai) ✓
- Two-sided wait ✓

### Invalid — Wrong Wait

```
123m 456m 234p 678s 55p
Waiting: 7s only (penchan 89s shape)
```

Same tiles, but if your actual shape is 89s waiting on 7, that's a penchan (edge wait), not ryanmen. No pinfu.

### Invalid — Yakuhai Pair

```
123m 456m 234p 678s EE (East pair, and East is your seat or round wind)
Waiting: 3-6m
```

The East pair scores fu because it's a relevant wind. No pinfu.

### Invalid — Contains Triplet

```
123m 456m 234p 555s 77p
Waiting: 3-6m
```

The 555s is a triplet. Even though you have sequences elsewhere, this disqualifies pinfu.

---

## The Wait Matters

Pinfu is unique because the same 14 tiles can qualify or disqualify based on your _actual wait_:

```
Hand: 234m 567m 11p 456s + 46p
```

- Waiting on **5p** = ryanmen (two-sided) = **pinfu valid**
- Waiting on **1p** = tanki (pair wait) = **pinfu invalid**

You must declare which tile completes which shape. If your winning tile could complete multiple shapes, you choose the interpretation, and you should choose ryanmen if possible.

## Common Combinations

|Combo|Han (Closed)|Notes|
|---|---|---|
|Pinfu + Riichi|2|Baseline combination|
|Pinfu + Tanyao|2|No terminals/honours, very common|
|Pinfu + Riichi + Tanyao|3|Bread-and-butter hand|
|Pinfu + Iipeikou|2|Two identical sequences|
|Pinfu + Sanshoku|3|Same sequence across three suits|
|Pinfu + Ittsuu|3|123-456-789 in one suit|
|Pinfu + Riichi + Tanyao + Iipeikou|4|Strong common hand|
|Pinfu + Chinitsu|7|Difficult but high value|

Pinfu cannot combine with:

- [[Toitoi]] (requires triplets)
- [[Chiitoitsu]] (no sequences)
- [[Sanankou]] (requires triplets)
- [[Honroutou]] (terminals/honours can't make sequences)

---

## Strategy Tips

### Building Toward Pinfu

1. **Prioritise ryanmen shapes** — Keep 23, 45, 67 type shapes; they give two-sided waits
2. **Avoid isolated honours early** — They can't form sequences
3. **Watch your pair** — If you're dealer (East) in East round, avoid East pair; both winds are yakuhai

### When to Abandon Pinfu

- You draw triplets naturally and toitoi becomes viable
- You need to call chi/pon for speed (pinfu requires closed hand)
- Your only realistic wait is kanchan or penchan
- Higher value alternatives emerge (honitsu, chinitsu)

### Efficiency Note

Pinfu hands tend to have high tile acceptance (good shape) because they require ryanmen waits. If you're struggling to reach tenpai with good waits, you might be holding too many isolated tiles or kanchan shapes. Pinfu discipline improves your overall efficiency.

---

## Fu Calculation Note

Pinfu has a special fu rule:

- **Ron:** 30 fu (base 20 + 10 for closed ron, but pinfu negates the menzen ron bonus in most rulesets, so effectively 30 fu flat)
- **Tsumo:** 20 fu (the only hand that can score exactly 20 fu)

This matters for score calculation. A 1 han 20 fu tsumo is lower than 1 han 30 fu ron, but you'll usually have additional yaku (riichi, tanyao) making this edge case rare.

---

## Related Yaku

- [[Tanyao]] — Extremely common pairing
- [[Iipeikou]] — Requires sequences, natural fit
- [[Sanshoku Doujun]] — Same sequence in three suits
- [[Ittsuu]] — 123-456-789 in one suit
- [[Ryanpeikou]] — Double iipeikou, combines with pinfu

---

## Summary

Pinfu rewards clean, efficient hand-building. It forces you to maintain good shape, avoid clunky waits, and stay closed for maximum flexibility. While only 1 han on its own, it combines effortlessly with other yaku to form the reliable 3-5 han hands that win games consistently.

Master pinfu, and you master the fundamentals.
