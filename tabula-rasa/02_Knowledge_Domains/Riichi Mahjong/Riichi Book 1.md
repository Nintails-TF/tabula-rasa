# Preface:

European players tend to struggle with riichi mahjong for as the majority of learning resources are for Japanese audiences. Hence, most European players are not playing at a sophisticated standard.

Riichi Book 1 attempts to remedy this - it is designed for players who are below the rank of 四段 (`Yondan/4th-Dan`, or Expert Mahjong Soul). Whereas Riichi Book 2 is for advanced players who are below 七段 (`Shichidan/7th-Dan` or Saint Mahjong Soul).

## Plan of the Book:

A balance between theoretical study, and practical play is the best approach to improving at mahjong. Learn chunks, then apply them to a game under real-time pressure and come back for more.

Within Tenhou and Mahjong Soul there are different rooms.

## Rankings:
### `一般/ippan` Lower-level Room (Novice-Adept):

The `ippan` (Bronze/Silver Room) is where players typically start out. Games can be chaotic and random, the rules are not very well understood and big mistakes are made regularly.
### `上級/joukyu` Upper-level Room (Expert-Master):

The `joukyu` (Gold/Low Jade Room) is where most players who have a solid grasp of the game lie, the quality of play is much more normal, but there is still many players who lack defence, do meaningless `dama` and poor `riichi`, and make serious mistakes relating to tile efficiency.

Most European players and tournaments operate at this level or the `ippan` level.
### `特上/tokujou` Advanced Room (Saint 1-2):

The `tokujou` (High Jade/Low Throne Room) is where intermediate players transform into advanced players, there are fewer fundamental errors, but defensive reading and situational judgment are still developing and games are similar to that of the `フリー/furii` mahjong parlours in Japan.
### `鳳凰/houou` Phoenix Room (Saint 3/Celestial):

The `houou` (High Throne Room) is where the best mahjong players in the world play. Whilst you may see a `houou` level player in a mahjong parlour, you don't normally play a game with four of them at once.

Mistake making is minimal and play approaches the professional standards of mahjong leagues, minus tournament pressure. The mental game becomes more important here.

## Reading Statistics:

### Placement Rates:

Ideally you want your placement rates to be a positive slope. You achieve first more than 2nd, 2nd more than 3rd, and so on. But you want your average placement to be **<2.5** which would state you are winning more than losing. 

**For instance:**
- **2.5** = break-even
- **2.4** = strong winning player
- **2.3** = very strong/expert tier
- **2.2** = elite territory

Placement rate only matters of over the course of a large enough sample size. (e.g. 100 games or so). You can calculate your average from percentages like so:

```Maths
(1 × 0.2791) + (2 × 0.3140) + (3 × 0.1977) + (4 × 0.2093) = 2.32
```
## Hand Statistics:

### `和了率/Agaritsu` Hand Win Rate :

`Agaritsu` is a measure of how many hands you win. Statistically you should have a 25% win rate of hands, so any win rate above 25% is strong.

Though win rate percentage depends on other factors:

- A lower deal-in rate but lower hand win rate is fine.
- Building big hands but having a lower win rate is fine.
	- Hand win rate should be consider along with hand-value and timing.
	- Winning 23% of hands with big hands is worth more than 28% winrate with cheap hands

### `放銃率/Houjuritsu` Deal-in Rate:

`Houjuritsu` is a measure of how many hands you got `Ronned` or fed your opponent the winning tile. You want to keep this down.

There are a few times where the best play would increase this:

1. You deal-off an opponent to secure your placement.
2. You discard dangerous tiles to secure your chance of winning a hand/securing a big hand.
	1. As this would increase your win-rate over time, even if you deal-in more.

The rule of thumb is that if you have a high deal-in rate, you need to win more, but if you have a low deal in rate you can win less. In other words:

```Maths
(Win rate - Deal-in rate) = 10% point gap. e.g.
27.77% - 14.67% = 13.1% (Good)
27.77% - 20% = 7.77% (Bad)
```

Your deal-in rate matters more as you climb up further, because the penalties for 4th place also rise. 
### `副露率/fukuroritsu` Call Rate:

`Fukuroritsu` is a measure of how many hands you play open `(chii/pon/kan)`. It measures your preference for open or closed hands. The basic idea, is don't open hands unless it secures a yaku.

Generally speaking as players improve, they call slightly more because they understand when to call or when to play fast.

### `立直率/tachinaoritsu` Riichi Rate:

`tachinaoritsu` is a measure of the hands which you call `riichi`. It measures your strategic approach to mahjong. 

Generally speaking, riichi rate tends to go down slightly as players improve, since they call more often or go into `dama` and thus can't riichi.
