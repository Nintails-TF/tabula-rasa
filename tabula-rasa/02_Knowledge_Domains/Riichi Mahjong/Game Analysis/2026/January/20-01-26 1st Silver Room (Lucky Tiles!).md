# 20-01-26 1st Silver Room (Lucky Tiles!)

**Summary:**
- Focus on discarding isolated honours early
	- Discard `hatsu` before `chun` to prevent all green yakuman.
- Break `penchan (edge waits)` shapes first as they are the weakest.
- Don't Pon or discard your only pair in the hand.
	- Also don't pon or chii if you don't have a valid yaku.
- Remember that `Iipeikou (Pure Double Sequence)` only works in closed hand /`Menzenchin`.
- Discard dangerous tiles more early than safer tiles.
	- e.g. breaking apart a `89m penchan` discard the `8m` first.

**MAKA Grade:** B
**Mortal Rating:** 73.8 (61.2%)
## Analysis:

- E1-T2 - Better to cut `4m` over `1p dora` since if I'm going to have a floating tile, may as well be the dora.
- E1-T3 - More efficient to keep the `4m` over the `2s` as it is a more flexible tile.
	- Mortal suggests 50:50 and that both tiles are equivalent. MAKA has a 10% preference towards `4m`.
- E1-T4 - Discarding the `2s` is the play here, but I don't know why.
	- This is because
- E2-T2 - The `9m` and the `chun` may seem equal, but they aren't. Since we can go for `pinfu` if we draw a pair of 9s and we have superior acceptance with a `9m/8m` draw.
- E3-T1 - The `9s` is a superior discard, because keeping the `nan` is stronger, since I'm in south seat and can potentially pivot into a `honistu` and if I draw another `nan` I can `pon` for a `yaku`.
- E3-T2 - The `1p` connects to the `34p` shape, whereas the `9s` is still not good here. So we should of cut the `9s`.
- E3-T3 - Cutting the `4s` is bad, because it's a flexible tile. Best to cut the `chun` as we can still draw into the `pei dora` pair, the solo dragon here doesn't do much for our hand's potential.
- E3-T4 - Cutting the `chun` or `3m` is superior here, as we can still draw into the dora.
- E3-T6 - Cutting `9s` is better than `7s` as I'm likely going to open my hand, the `7s` hold means a few different things: 
	1. **If I pon the `sha` or `chun` or both. I still have a pair to complete my hand.**
		1. If I only `pon` one of them, I can pon if someone discards a `7s`, speeding up my hand. So its more flexible
	2. I've got 2 tiles of acceptance compared to 4 with the `7-9 penchan`
		1. This shows that looking a pure tile-efficiency isn't always the solution.
- E3-T7 - Cutting the `7s` now gives me an elongated shape which is more efficient than a `penchan`. So I'd cut the `7s then 9s`.
- E3-T8 - Better to cut the `7s` as I can't ron for it anymore, but I could with the `9s` because of `furiten`.
- E3-T9-Pon - `Ponning` is not ideal, because it removes the only pair in my hand, so I have to draw into another pair to be in `tenpai`.
	- MAKA says 30:70 Towards `pon`. Mortal says 15:85
- E3-T11 - We cut the `6m` earlier, since we want to get rid of the more dangerous tile early, then discard the `8m` later.
- E3-R1-T2 - The `chun` has less value than the `nan` here since, one is already on the field and I'm more likely to draw into the `nan` giving me seat wind.
- E4-T2 - Why is it better to discard the `hatsu` over the `chun` here? Aren't they both the same?
	- It's because by holding onto the `hatsu` you increase the chances of the `Ryuuiisou` (All Green) yakuman happening to yourself, as it gives more time towards your opponent.
		- The odds of this are small, but if you aren't going for it or a half-flush, it's better to discard.
- E4-T4 - Single honour tiles again, better to get rid of the `sha` here as I've transitioned past the early discards and want to focus on tile acceptance.
- S1-T2 - `1s` discard is better, since we can draw into either a `chun` or `hatsu`. 
- S1-T5 - Discarding the lone honour tile of `pei` is better, since again. I'm in a state where I'm looking to build a functional hand.
- S1-T8 - Better to cut `1p` since it doesn't help tile acceptance.
- S1-R1-T4 - MUCH better to cut the `89m penchan` accept the red `5m` and treat the `5p` as the pair within the hand. I break apart my only pair, whilst is really bad.
- S1-R1-T5 - We want to cut the most dangerous tile first so the `8m -> 9m`, not the `9m` first.
- S2-T7-Chii - `Chii` here is bad, because I don't have a valid yaku, pure double sequence is closed hand only - I forgot.
- S3-T1 - Cutting the `1m` removes a `penchan` shape, were as the `6s and 6p` don't help at all here.
- S3-T3 - Cutting the `1s` hurts my shape, better to get rid of the floating `6p`.
	- S3-T4 - Now the `2s` has no purpose so we should cut it, rather than the `haku`, since the `2s` will be more dangerous to discard in the future.
- S3-T7 - Breaking my `67 ryanmen` for no reason here???
- S3-1-T1 - Cutting the `1m` is better, since it's not a strong tile, and we want to keep the door open for a `honitsu`.
	- S3-1-T2 - Same principle.
- S3-1-T9 - Need to remember global `genbutsu` so I know the `9p` is safe. I should of just folded rather than chasing.
- S4-T1-Chii - `Chii` was OK since I wanted to go for a fast hand that was `tanyao` to win the game. It's a slight mistake, playing it slower is better, but not the end of the world.
- S4-T8 - Cutting the `4m` is superior as we are breaking apart a `78 ryanmen` for a pair, which is bad.
