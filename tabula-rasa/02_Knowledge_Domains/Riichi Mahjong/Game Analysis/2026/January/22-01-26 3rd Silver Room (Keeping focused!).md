# 22-01-26 3rd Silver Room (Keeping focused!)

**Summary:**
- Discard lone honour tiles a bit earlier.
- Keep the more flexible tiles earlier, lone honours aren't so good, lone terminals or terminals like the example in `E2-R1-T1`, where the terminal doesn't improve our hand if we draw.
- Speedy hands aren't bad, but they need to come with as little drawbacks as possible. I overlooked that I could be locked out of `tanyao`.
- 

## Analysis:

- E1-T1: Cutting `9s` better, since you want to keep the door open for `honitsu`.
- E1-T2: Similar idea to `E1-T1`, keep the `chun` and `sha` for half-flush.
- E1-T5: Better to cut the `9s` over the `2s` since the two has better tile acceptance.
- E1-T7: Recognised this in game after I cut the `8m`, I held on to my single honour tile `sha` for too long.
	- Good to see that I'm learning this and internalising this in game.
- E1-T9-Pon: Better to skip here, as whilst I do move from 2-shanten, to 1-shanten. Two things happen.
	1. I lock myself into `tanyao` which is not guaranteed. See a `9p` draw would be bad now.
	2. The value of my hand decreases, since I can't `riichi`.
		1. Now, MAKA doesn't hate this it's about 40:60 to either `pon/kan` or skip. But its still not a good play.
- E1-R1-T2: Now going for `honitsu` here is not so good. As I'd need to break my `34s` shape. Cutting the `pei` is superior here. You've got a good chance of `tanyao` + `pinfu` in this hand.
- E1-R1-R3: Similar to E1-R1-T2. We cut the `pei` first over the `8s`.
- E1-R1-R3: Similar to E1-R1-T2. We cut the `pei` first over the `ton`. The ton is worth `2 han` if we get a triplet of it, so it's worth much more even with one `sha` discarded.
- E2-T1: The lone `Nan` discard first is better than a disconnected honour discard in the form of `9s`.
- E2-T3: Cut the `8s` before the `haku` since we can still draw into a haku, and the `8s` will struggle to link up with anything, as if we got a `78s ryanmen` and drew a 9 now, we would potentially be in `furiten`.
- E2-T5: We actually want to keep the `ton`, since we see all three other `ton` discarded, meaning it is a 100% safe tile. Whereas the `8s` would be more dangerous in the future.
	- This is a dead-honour tile (`Kyoushi`). It only loses to `Kukuoshi Musou/Thirteen Orphans.
- E2-T11: Better to discard the `sha`, since east lord has declared `riichi`. Discarding the `9p` hurts my hand more than the sha discard.
- **E2-R1-T1:** Cutting the `9s` is better since.
	- If you drew 8s you would have a kanchan (68s) and if you drew a 7s you would have a ryanmen (67s), so no need to keep the 9.
	- A more advanced version of `Heritsu` or tile efficiency. 
- E2-R1-T2: Similar idea to T1.
- E2-R1-T8: Better to cut the `6s`, since the `3p` can build a `345p` shape and we keep the `667p` as a ryanmen + pair.
- E2-R1-T10: Looking at south lords open hand, we should realise that they are waiting for a dragon tile, so discarding the `chun` here is very risky and I should of dealed in? But my opponent didn't `ron` me???
- E3-T11: Cutting the `9s` is better since the kanchan wait for the `8s` has more acceptance then waiting for a triplet of the `9s` since they are two `9s` already down on the table.
- S1-T2: Cutting the `1m` is stronger than the `1p` as we keep the option of a `123p` shape alive, whilst the `1m` doesn't improve the hand.
- S1-T4: Since the pair of `nan` will always be our eyes in the hand. we don't need one of the `8p`, so we can discard one and stay with a kanchan.
