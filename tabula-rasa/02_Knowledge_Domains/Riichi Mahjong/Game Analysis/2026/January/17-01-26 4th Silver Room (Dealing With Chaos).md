# 17-01-26 4th Silver Room (Dealing With Chaos):

**Summary:**

- Single Valueless Winds → Isolated Terminals (1s/9s) → Single Dragons → Seat wind (if not also round wind) → Round wind → Isolated Near-terminals (2s/8s) → Isolated Middle tiles (3-7)
	- These change if dora indicators, suit isolation, in-hand pairs, connections, specific yaku opportunities. Read your hand first, see if any caveats apply, then move to default technique.
- Consider folding, when the opponent has multiple dora in an open hand.
- Don't overlook half-flushes or full-flushes.
- Avoid making errors of hurting tile acceptance. Keep good tiles and discard tiles that don't improve tile acceptance.

**MAKA Grade:** B+

# Analysis:

## East 1:
### Turn 1:

Develop a standardised formula for discarding bad tiles in the first few turns.

### Turn 9:

**Danger levels!** East lord is the dealing and has 3 `dora` from a `ponned` triplet. MAKA suggests to start folding here already. I'm two tiles away from tenpai and I push, and end up winning the hand.

Both Mortal and MAKA want to fold here.

Basically, if someone has a ton of dora tiles secured from a `pon`, you want to fold right away. Because the risk isn't worth pushing for, if you are wrong, and get `ronned` you lose more than you will gain.

## East 2:

### Turn 3:

Better to discard an isolated terminal than the green dragon, as I can draw into a potential `yakuhai`, which since a green dragon has already been discarded, will be a good `pon` target.

But getting rid of my `9m -> 9P -> hatsu` will likely be what happens.

## Turn 4:

Cutting `9m` is better than `2p`, since the 2p actually does increase tile acceptance and the 9 does not. 

## Turn 8+:

North lord has 4 `dora` and just `kanned 8m`, we need to be folding here, I look to stay in tenpai on turn 10 and deal-into the right lord and get hit by a `Baiman` for 16,000 points. Mortal AI and MAKA both agree, with Mortal being more sure about folding and MAKA allowing slightly more aggressive choices.

Same principle as E1-T9, just that I got punished for it this time.

## East 3:

### Turn 1:

Discarding the isolated `sha` isn't strong, since we can aim for a half-flush (`Honitsu`) which is a cool 3 han hand if close, 2 if open.

### Turn 9:

Don't understand why I discarded the `4p`, since it's a `ryanmen wait`. Better to cut the `1s or 6m`, as they don't increase tile acceptance. 

# Turn 10:

`Kanning` the `chun` is risky, as I have no way of knowing that I'm going to win the hand. But I took the risk because I had 11k points and I was in forth, It ended up working out, but I was against a riichi, if they had hit, I could of been bankrupt and lost right away. 

## East 4:

## Turn 2:

We want to cut the `9p` as since we already have a `688p` shape a `7p` would complete a sequence anyways, and I can still hit the `ton`, which is worth more since I'd get the seat wind and prevalent wind.

I've got enough lessons from this game, I think focussing on what I've learned here will be the low hanging fruit.
