# 18-01-26 3rd Silver Room (Get Rid of Those honours!)

**Summary:**
- Discard honour tiles over terminal tiles, as they have worse acceptance.
- Remember that the round wind changes.
- The Ryankan shape is powerful. 
- Cut wind tiles counter-clockwise if not prevalent wind, try feed into the player on my left, rather than right.
- Work on developing repetitions for proper tile acceptance.

**MAKA Grade:** B
**Mortal Rating:** 69.2 (58.9% Matches)

## Analysis:

**East 1:**
- E1-T1: It's better to cut `pei` rather than the `nan`? Why?
	- You want to toss wind tiles counter-clockwise. As if the person on your left `pons` the tile, you get another draw.
	- You cut the north wind first, since it gives south lord more time to potentially pon the south wind, which helps me out more.
- E1-T3: Cutting the `3p` hurts because it breaks up a useful pair, better to discard `3m` as it's not part of any shape.

**East 2:**
- E2-T1: `1s` has a better acceptance than `pei`. As it can hit `11s, 12s`, where as the `pei` can only become a pair.
- E2-T8: `5m` is actually the discard, as the `1-3-5m` shape is a `ryankan` (bootleg ryanmen wait). Accepting the `5m` would risk my pair as well.
- E3-T11: I get the chance to `closed kan` and I decline. I'm in `Iishanten` so actually going for a kan on a closed hand here is fine.

**East 3:**
- E3-T2: Cutting `2s` is bad because it has much better acceptance than other tiles already present in my hand. Cutting `9m or chun` is much better.
- E3-T4: Cutting `chun` is best because keeping the `2m` enables a `2-3-4m` shape, and you get a ryanmen wait with the `5-6`.
	- T5-T7 - Similar idea.

**East 4:**
- E4-T1: Cutting the `ton` is good here, because it's a useless tile with one draw, the `nan` is more likely to draw into a pair.
- E4-T3: Similar to **E2-T1**, better to cut the east wind and keep the 9 for acceptance.
	- I'm not at the level yet where I need to worry about keeping safe tiles in hand. (`Sakagiri`). But MAKA and mortal say it's roughly even.
- E4-T7: Cutting the `8s` isn't good since it hurt acceptance and I can potentially draw into a `Iipeikou` (Pure Double Sequence).

**South 1:**
- S1-T1: I forgot that the prevalent wind changed, cutting the `ton` should be priority.
	- T2 + T4 same story.
- S1-T6: Cutting the `2p` is superior here, since we see a `3p` on the board already. Meaning the `46` shanpon is better than then `24`
- S1-T11: Riiching here wasn't good. I don't know why.

**South 2:**
- S2-T3: Forgot that south wind was seat and prevalent wind here.
	- Same thing with T4, T6, T8

**South 3:**
- S3-T2: Better to cut the `hatsu` as cutting my pair of nines hurts tile acceptance, I have a nice two pair structure already.
	- T3, T5 are similar problems.
- S3-T9: Should cut the `9s` over the drawn `2m` since I've got a `6-8` shanpon, a 7 completes a sequence either way.
	- T11, T12, T13 - similar principle

**South 4:**
- S4-T1: Even though I have a triplet of the `4p`, discarding the `chun` is better, since my triplet of the `4p` can break down into `44p 45p`. Which is good.
