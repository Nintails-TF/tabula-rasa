It's hard to beat modernity, since you've got to operate within it. The best move is to leverage it without being crushed by it. Which is revolution through discipline.

Freedom is only bought with discipline, if you aren't disciplined and do what you need to do, you will only suffer.

The world and it's people are results-oriented whilst they preach about the process. Focus on your own processes: act civil, kind, and approachable whilst building fearsome strengths, weapons, and wealth. Through a disciplined and systematic process.
