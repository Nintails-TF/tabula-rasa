# Politics Core

Ally with competent, secure people who gain from your growth. Be undeniably skilled but frame it as collaborative and generous. Make others feel elevated by working with you, not diminished. Build a reputation as "excellent AND makes everyone around them better."

Calibration with being humble is important, underplaying it (making people feel weak/stupid/inferior) or overplaying it (self-sabotage, low-confidence, etc.) is not a good approach. Confident and Respectful is key.

Unpredictability is key - having an unknown ceiling or capability is more important than being fully known in this way.

**Do not telegraph aggression** - conceal your intentions, keep options open, and frame positively to maintain plausible deniability. 

Underestimation is the primary weapon. A man who looks massively built and strong, causes other to raise their barriers. Whilst someone who is ripped underneath clothes, but looks unremarkable can operate freely.

Use the amount of force that is required for the situation, if struggling aim for a little bit less, than a little bit more. Slight underperformance is acceptable in a hard situation, but ideally you perform well enough in tough situations as to keep your peak hidden. This is **strategic sandbagging.**

Treat revelations as statistical outliers, isolate them, create noise, and let the memory fade.

Do not seem too perfect, keep some parts rough or messy, this is when you must be careful to not let anything meaningful slip, but to let some surface level or regular data be expressed.

Defer things that people want to already fulfil and that you don't want to do or aren't mission critical. Let them be the hero when related to X, since it doesn't compete with you and frees you up more.
