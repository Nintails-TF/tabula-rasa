## Cognitive:
- Having time and space to organise my thoughts and ideas.
- Being able to learn new skills.
- No constant sensory overload. Ability to have peace and quiet.
## Emotional:
- Feeling secure and stable.
- Not getting constantly shamed about the things I do.
## Social:
- Sending a few messages online or having a brief exchange with another person.
- Feeling like what I do has some amount of value to other people/world.
## Autonomy:
- Being able to pick my poison and suffer towards something that matters to me.
