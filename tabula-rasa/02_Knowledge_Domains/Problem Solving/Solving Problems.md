# Introduction:

## Systems Thinking:

**Systems thinking** is best used to solve abstract/concrete problems.

Scope:
- Well defined boundaries and goals
- Analysing complex systems and how they operate.
	- Reveals why processes fail/work.
	- Incentives, feedback, loops, constraints.
- Willpower and motivation are unreliable/absent.
- Measurable states and outcomes
- Repeatable
- Success criteria is relatively clear

Systems thinking can be used in every problem, because if you optimise the process itself or the variables around the process, you are better positioned.

More information or gathering information in a concise and digestible way, can lead to improved decision making

**Danger:**
- Optimising a system doesn't mean you've solved the root problem.
	- You can have a systematic approach to relationships, but fail to connect with people.
- You can pretend that a soft problem is actually hard and avoid emotional/philosophical work.
	- I need to have the perfect routine > What do I actually want.
- You can systematise or analysis all day without actually executing anything.
	- Avoid "analysis paralysis"

## Soft Problems:

Philosophy/exploration is best used when a problem is more personal or emotional.

Scope:
- Boundaries are fuzzy
- Solutions are heuristics, and aren't universal.
- Success is subjective or has many facets
- More information doesn't always help, it may just increase complexity.

Negative emotions often occur when there is a divide between values and action. If you don't act in accordance with your values, you feel negative. When you do act in accordance with your values, you feel more positive.

**Danger:**
- Endlessly exploring or fantasising without executing.
	- Being stuck in your own dreams.
- Making emotionally-driven decisions and retrofitting justifications

## Hybrid Problems:

Most problems have elements of both, and a person's temperament dictates if they would lean either towards the harder/softer approach. 

Problems like dieting or exercise are great examples:
- **Hard parts:** Calories, macros, progressive overload, sleep tracking, meal prep logistics
- **Soft parts:** Why you want to be fit, your relationship with your body, what "healthy" means to you, handling emotional eating, identity shifts
- **The hybrid approach:** Use systems to make execution easy (meal prep, training schedule), but periodically check in on the soft questions to ensure you're building toward something meaningful, not just optimizing metrics

Use systems thinking to understand constraints and optimize execution; use soft thinking to set direction and ensure alignment with values.

**Danger:**
- Don't inject softness into problems that require hardness and vice versa. A hybrid approach isn't universal and could subtract from core idea.

## Approach Picking:

- **Systematic** - Direction is clear and execution is the bottleneck.
- **Soft** - Unclear what is wanted/needed, chasing unsatisfying metrics.
- **Hybrid** - "Soft thinking identifies direction → Systems thinking optimizes execution → Soft thinking reviews alignment → Refine system based on insights → repeat"
