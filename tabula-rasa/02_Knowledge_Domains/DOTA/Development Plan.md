# Development Plan

## What is My Goal with DOTA?
To experience Dota as a **disciplined, reliable** support player who enables teammates through **consistency** and **fundamentals** - understanding the game through the lens of stable, foundational play rather than highlight-reel moments.

Secondary goal: To understand what elite supports like N0tail experienced during championship runs - the satisfaction of being the anchor that allows everything else to work.

This means success isn't measured by your rank or flashy plays, but by:
- Becoming someone teammates trust and want to play with.
- Having the game sense to read situations and enable others.
- Finding satisfaction in perfect execution of "boring" fundamentals.
- Understanding high-level support decision-making even if you can't execute at pro level.

## How Should I Split My Playtime?

_Weeks 1-4 (Foundation):_
- 70% playing (bot games, unranked)
- 20% watching educational content (tutorials, basic guides)
- 10% practice mode (last hitting, pulling camps)

_Months 2-6 (Skill Building):_
- 60% playing (unranked, then ranked)
- 25% review (watching your own replays)
- 15% studying (watching high-MMR support players, educational content)

_Months 7-12 (Refinement):_
- 65% playing (ranked games)
- 20% review (your replays, focused on one aspect at a time)
- 10% studying (pro player perspectives, specific hero guides)
- 5% practice mode (hero-specific mechanics)

_Year 2+ (Mastery/Maintenance):_
- 70% playing
- 20% review
- 10% staying current (patch notes, meta shifts, new strategies)

**Actual time commitment:**
- About 10 hours per week, 1 hour per day on weekdays, a little more on weekends or holidays.
- Remember: One focused game with review > three mindless games.

## What Do I Need to Learn Initially?:

_Phase 1 (Month 1): Game Literacy_
- How the map works (lanes, jungle, shops, objectives)
- What items do and how to buy them
- How experience and gold work
- Basic hero abilities (yours and common enemies)
- How to not die (positioning basics, reading danger)
- The courier and how to use it

_Phase 2 (Months 2-3): Support Fundamentals_
- Laning: harassing, pulling, stacking, denying
- Ward placement (standard spots first)
- When to leave lane and rotate
- Basic itemization (what to buy and when)
- How to protect your carry
- Map awareness (minimap every 3-5 seconds)

_Phase 3 (Months 4-6): Game Sense_
- Reading enemy movements and predicting ganks
- Smoke timings and rotation patterns
- Objective priority (when to push, when to take Roshan)
- When to trade your life (dying with purpose)
- Vision warfare (where/when to deward)
- Understanding power spikes and timing windows

_Phase 4 (Months 7-12): Refinement_
- Advanced laning (creep equilibrium, aggro manipulation)
- Team coordination (setting up plays, enabling cores)
- Economy management (how greedy can you be)
- Draft awareness (counters, synergies, win conditions)
- Advanced warding (based on game state, not just spots)
- Communication and shot-calling

## What Hero Pool Am I Aiming For?:




## What Does the End-result Look Like?:

**In-game performance:**
- Consistently have <6 deaths per game
- Maintain 85%+ observer ward uptime
- Win lane for your carry in 70%+ of games
- Execute your hero's core combo/pattern reliably
- Make correct rotation decisions 60%+ of the time
- End games with assist-to-death ratio of 2:1 or better

**Game knowledge:**
- Understand all 100+ heroes' basic abilities
- Know standard ward spots and when to use them
- Recognize enemy power spikes and timing windows
- Read the minimap and predict enemy movements
- Know your itemization path for each hero in your pool

**The intangibles (this is what you're really chasing):**
- You understand _why_ pros make the decisions they do
- You can watch a pro support game and follow their thought process
- You feel the satisfaction of a perfectly executed smoke gank
- You experience the trust dynamic of enabling a carry's farm
- You understand what N0tail meant by "everything can work" - not because anything is viable, but because disciplined execution trumps perfect draft

**Realistic MMR expectations:**
- After 500 hours: 1000-1500 MMR (Guardian/Crusader)
- After 1000 hours: 1500-2500 MMR (Crusader/Archon)
- After 2000 hours: 2000-3000 MMR (Archon/Legend)

But remember: MMR isn't your goal. Understanding the game is. The goal is the _experience_ and _understanding_, not the number.

## When Do I Stop or Maintain?:

**You might STOP when:**
- You've achieved your goal of understanding support play at a competent level
- The game stops being enjoyable (Dota can be toxic and draining)
- You've experienced what you wanted - that lens into championship-level support play
- Life circumstances change and you don't have 5-10 hours/week
- You realize you'd rather watch than play

**You shift to MAINTENANCE when:**
- You can execute your hero pool reliably
- You understand the strategic layer of the game
- You're comfortable at your current skill level
- You want to keep the skill but not actively improve

**Maintenance mode looks like:**
- 2-4 games per week (enough to stay sharp)
- Minimal review (just check if you're developing bad habits)
- Patch note reading (stay current with changes)
- Maybe watch major tournaments for enjoyment

**You keep PUSHING when:**
- You're still improving and finding satisfaction in growth
- You've found a consistent stack and it's a social activity
- The strategic puzzle still engages you
- You want to see how far you can take it

**My recommendation:**

Give yourself **one full year** of disciplined practice before deciding. That's enough time to:
- Get through the brutal learning curve
- Understand what high-level play looks like
- Experience genuine improvement and satisfaction
- Decide if you want to continue or maintain

After year one, reassess every 6 months:
- Am I still enjoying this?
- Am I still learning?
- Is this how I want to spend my gaming time?
