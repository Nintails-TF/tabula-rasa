# Morphy Opera Game - Practice Drills

## 🎯 Goal: Move from "I understand" to "I See it instantly"

---

## Drill 1: Position Recognition (5 mins)

**Set up these 3 positions. Find the key move in <10 seconds each.**

### Position A: After 6...Nf6

```
Setup: White has Bc4, Qf3. Black has Nf6, Qe7, e5 pawn.
Black's weaknesses: f7, b7
```

**Find:** Double attack move **Answer:** Qb3 **Why it works:** Attacks f7 and b7, Black can't defend both

---

### Position B: After 9...b5

```
Setup: White Bc4, Qb3, Nc3. Black played ...b5 (weakening move).
Black's queen on e7, king on e8 (uncastled).
```

**Find:** Forcing sacrifice **Answer:** Nxb5 **Why it works:** Opens c-file, after cxb5 Bxb5+ Black's king is doomed

---

### Position C: After 15...Nxd7

```
Setup: Black king on e8, knight on d7, queen on e6
White has Qb3, Rd1
```

**Find:** Queen sacrifice for mate **Answer:** Qb8+ **Why it works:** Nxb8 forced, then Rd8# (back rank mate)

---

**Daily Target:** Set up all 3, find moves in <30 seconds total

---

## Drill 2: Pattern Hunt in YOUR Games (10 mins)

**Open your last 5 games. Look for ONE of these:**

- [ ] **Slow developer:** Opponent's king in centre move 10+
- [ ] **Double attack:** Undefended pieces on different sides
- [ ] **Development lead:** You have 3+ pieces out, opponent has 1-2
- [ ] **Material grab:** You took pawn but gave opponent time to develop
- [ ] **Back rank:** Opponent's king on 1st/8th rank with no escape

**Action:** Screenshot ONE position, note which pattern applies

**Weekly Goal:** Find 1 position per week where Opera Game principles would help

---

## Drill 3: Play the Position (15 mins)

**Setup Lichess vs Stockfish Level 3-5**

### Option A: Attack (from Move 6)

Position: After 5...dxe5 (White to move) **Goal:** Find Bc4, Qb3, Nc3 naturally. Find the Nxb5 sacrifice. **Success:** You see Nxb5 within 1 minute

### Option B: Defend (from Move 6)

Position: After 5...dxe5 (White to move) **Goal:** Survive as Black against Stockfish **Success:** You don't fall for Qb3/Nxb5 traps

### Option C: Convert the Sacrifice (from Move 10)

Position: After 10. Nxb5 cxb5 11. Bxb5+ Nbd7 **Goal:** Finish Black off with forcing moves **Success:** You find O-O-O, Rxd7, Rd1, Qb8+

---

## Drill 4: Opposite Side Practice (15 mins)

**Defend the Philidor vs Stockfish Level 5**

Position: After 3. d4 (Black to move)

**Try these defenses:**

1. 3...Bg4 (what Black played - should lose)
2. 3...exd4 (releasing tension)
3. 3...Nd7 (supporting e5)

**Question after each:** Why does 3...Bg4 fail but others survive?

**Success:** You explain why 3...Bg4 loses development battle

---

## Drill 5: Speed Recall (5 mins)

**Close your eyes and answer:**

1. What was Morphy's 7th move? (||Qb3||)
2. What was the brilliant sacrifice? (||Nxb5||)
3. What was the final combination? (||Qb8+ Nxb8, Rd8#||)
4. Why did Black lose? (||Slow development, king in center||)
5. What's the main principle? (||Development > Material in sharp positions||)

**Success:** 5/5 correct without looking
