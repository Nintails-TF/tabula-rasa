# Endgame Study Plan

> _"In the endgame, technique and clarity reign supreme"_ - J. R. Capablanca
## Core Philosophy

Study positions so that you deeply understand them and can clearly explain and understand what the best approach is. Rote memorisation isn't the goal, but having an accurate, clean, and clinical technique.

---
# Foundation Level (1000-1200): Basic Mastery

_Goal: Never lose a winning position_
## Phase 1: Elementary Checkmates (2-3 weeks)

**Study Method:**
1. **Queen + King vs King** - Practice until under 10 moves, 100% accuracy
2. **Rook + King vs King** - Practice until under 16 moves, 100% accuracy
3. **Two Bishops + King vs King** - Practice until under 30 moves, 100% accuracy

**Capablanca's Approach:**
- Don't just memorize the moves - understand the **logic**:
    - "Why does the king need to go here?"
    - "What square am I trying to control?"
    - "How do I restrict my opponent's options?"
- Practice against a friend or computer until it feels **automatic**
- The goal: these positions should feel as natural as breathing

**Daily Practice:** 15 minutes - Set up random positions, execute the checkmate

---

## Phase 2: King + Pawn Fundamentals (3-4 weeks)

**Core Concepts to Master:**

1. **Opposition** (Direct, Distant, Diagonal)
    - Study until you can **feel** when you have opposition
    - Practice: "If I move here, do I maintain opposition?"
2. **Key Squares** (The 3 squares in front of your pawn)
    - Understand: Control key squares = win, lose them = draw
    - Practice identifying key squares instantly in any position
3. **Basic Wins and Draws**
    - Know when K+P vs K is won or drawn
    - Understand the principle: **King activity is everything**

**Study Method (Capablanca Style):**
- Set up positions, **don't look at the solution**
- Ask yourself: "What is the natural, clear plan here?"
- Play it out, see if you're right
- If wrong, understand **why** the correct move works
- Replay until the pattern becomes **intuitive**

**Daily Practice:** 20 minutes
- 5 positions per day
- Alternate between solving and setting up random K+P positions

---

# Development Level (1200-1400): Practical Technique

_Goal: Convert clear advantages consistently_
## Phase 3: Rook Endgame Mastery (6-8 weeks)

_"Rook endgames are the foundation of endgame technique"_

**Essential Positions:**

1. **Lucena Position** (Building the Bridge)
    - Don't just memorize - understand **why** the rook goes to the 4th rank
    - Practice until you can explain it to someone else
2. **Philidor Position** (The Drawing Technique)
    - Understand the defensive principles
    - Practice both sides: winning AND defending
3. **Rook vs Lone Pawn**
    - When is it won? When drawn?
    - Learn the **critical squares** for the defending king

**Capablanca's Study Method:**

```
Week 1-2: Lucena Position
- Day 1: Study the position, understand the principle
- Days 2-4: Practice setting it up from different configurations
- Days 5-7: Test yourself - can you win from random starting positions?

Week 3-4: Philidor Position
- Same method, but learn BOTH sides
- Practice defending hopeless-looking positions

Week 5-6: Rook vs Pawn
- Study all critical cases
- Build intuition for when rook wins/draws

Week 7-8: Mixed Practice
- Random rook endgame positions
- Focus on UNDERSTANDING why each move is best
```

**Daily Practice:** 30 minutes
- 3 positions per day
- Play them out completely
- Journal: "What principle made this position win/draw?"

---

### **Competence Level (1400-1600): Advanced Understanding**

_Goal: Handle complex endgames with clarity_

## Phase 4: Minor Piece Endgames (6-8 weeks)

**Study Areas:**

1. **Bishop vs Knight Principles**
    - When is the bishop better? (open positions, both flanks)
    - When is the knight better? (blocked positions, one flank)
    - **Capablanca's insight**: "It's about the pawn structure, not the pieces"
2. **Opposite-Coloured Bishops**
    - Why are these often drawn?
    - When CAN you win with OCB?
    - Practice the defensive technique
3. **Same-Colored Bishops**
    - Good bishop vs bad bishop
    - How to create weaknesses

**Study Method:**
- **Compare and contrast**: Set up similar positions with different pieces
- "Why does the bishop win here but the knight wins there?"
- Build **principles**, not positions

**Daily Practice:** 30 minutes
- 2-3 themed positions
- Focus on understanding the **type** of position, not memorizing

---

## Phase 5: Complex Rook Endgames (Ongoing)

**Advanced Concepts:**

1. **Active vs Passive Rook**
    - "Activity is worth material in the endgame"
    - Practice creating and exploiting active rooks
2. **Multiple Pawn Rook Endgames**
    - Passed pawn creation
    - Attacking weak pawns
    - The principle of **two weaknesses**
3. **Cutting Off the King**
    - How to use the rook to restrict the enemy king
    - When to trade into pawn endgames

**Capablanca's Approach:**
- Study master games (particularly Capablanca and Rubinstein)
- Don't just play through - **stop and think**:
    - "What is the plan here?"
    - "Why this move over other candidates?"
    - "What principle is being applied?"

## The Daily Practice Routine

### Morning Session (15-20 minutes)
- **Warm-up**: One basic checkmate or K+P position
- **Focus**: Review one principle you're currently studying
### Evening Session (30-40 minutes)
- **Study**: 2-3 new positions from your current phase
- **Play**: Practice the positions against engine/friend
- **Reflect**: Journal what you learned
### Weekly Review (1 hour)
- Replay all positions from the week
- Test yourself: Can you win/draw these from memory?
- Identify weak areas for next week

---

## Capablanca's Key Study Principles

### 1. Understand, Don't Memorize

Ask constantly:
- "WHY does this move win?"
- "What principle is at work here?"
- "Could I explain this to someone else?"

### 2. Play Both Sides

- Practice winning positions
- Practice defending losing positions
- Understanding the defence makes you a better attacker

### 3. Seek Clarity

- If a position feels confusing, you don't understand it yet
- The correct move should feel **natural** after study
- "When I see this position, the right move should be obvious"

### 4. Quality Over Quantity

- Better to deeply understand 5 positions than superficially know 50
- Replay critical positions 10, 20, 50 times until they're **intuitive**

### 5. Build From Simple to Complex

- Master K+P before studying complex rook endgames
- Each level builds on the previous
- **Never skip fundamentals**

---

## Recommended Study Materials

**Books (Capablanca-style clarity):**
1. **Basic Chess Endings** - Reuben Fine (systematic, clear)
2. **Chess Fundamentals** - Capablanca
3. **100 Endgames You Must Know** - Jesus de la Villa (practical focus)

**Study Method:**
- Don't read cover-to-cover
- Study one section at a time
- Work through every position
- Test yourself before looking at solutions

---

## Progress Tracking

### Weekly Self-Assessment

Ask yourself:
- [ ] Can I explain **why** the winning moves work?
- [ ] Do the patterns feel natural now, or still forced?
- [ ] Could I teach this position to someone else?
- [ ] Am I winning these types of positions in my games?

### Monthly Review

- Play through 10 random positions from what you've studied
- Track your success rate
- Identify patterns you still struggle with
- **Capablanca's standard**: 90%+ accuracy before moving forward
