# Industry Overview:

There are a lot of things I don't understand, but I do get computers and tech. For this reason, I want to stick inside of my circle of competence with these things.

This is a great time for me because the AI boom and bust gives me an avenue to invest and understand systems. 

The main point is that I don't have a scooby who will win the AGI race, but selling to the idea that AI companies will need to buy or that the world will need to invest in more infrastructure or other services for a digitized world is the idea.
