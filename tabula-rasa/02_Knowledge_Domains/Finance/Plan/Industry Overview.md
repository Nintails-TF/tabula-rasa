# Markets to Invest In:

## Defence 🎯

**Why it works:** European defence budgets projected to grow 6.8% annually through 2035, with spending rising from 2.4% to 3.2-3.5% of GDP by 2030—adding $200-300 billion in new spending. This isn't political speculation; governments have already committed funds. Companies report record backlogs (Rheinmetall: €62.6B) and multi-year visibility. Ukraine war + US unreliability = structural, decade-long spending cycle regardless of election outcomes.

War and conflict are on peoples horizon at the moment, along with the potential of Nationalist right-wing leaders being elected into government, who love civic participation and military spending.

There is a lot of greed going on in defence, perhaps it pays to be more scared.

**Risk:** Many stocks already up 100-200%+. Some investor impatience emerging.

## Cybersecurity 🔒

**Why it works:** EU's NIS2 Directive forces 160,000+ entities into mandatory compliance by 2026, with penalties up to €10M or 2% of global turnover. Not optional—it's regulatory. Average security spending jumping to 9% of IT budgets, creating forced demand. Global cybersecurity spending projected to grow from $196B (2025) to $262B (2030). Spending is non-discretionary and recession-resistant.

More information and data going online - particularly biometric data, personal, details. Cybersecurity will rise eventually, especially in response to turbulence.

**Edge:** Near-term catalyst (2026) vs. vague political outcomes in 2027-2029.

## Automation/Robotics 🤖

**Why it works:** European industrial robots market growing 9.5% CAGR, from $4.6B (2024) to $36.8B (2033). Collaborative robots (cobots) demand growing 11.2% in Europe as costs fall and AI integration makes them smarter. Works whether populists win or lose—demographic reality drives adoption.

**Labour shortages + anti-immigration policies + aging populations** = Make machines do more of the heavy lifting.

**Sweet spot:** Europe's Industry 4.0 + reshoring manufacturing trends already underway.

Time horizon is too long.

## Energy / Especially Nuclear⚡

**Why it works:** EU committed to $750B in US LNG/oil/nuclear purchases through 2028 to replace Russian supplies. Energy security is now strategic priority. Nuclear generation forecast to hit all-time high in 2025 as Europe restarts reactors and builds new capacity. European energy majors offer 6-13% dividend yields while trading at 20-39% below fair value. You get paid to wait.

AI and ChatGPT accelerate the demand for energy as well, if more infrastructure is being built - more energy is needed to reply.

**Bonus:** Traditional energy benefits from populist scepticism of rapid green transitions while still participating in nuclear/LNG growth.

Energy ETFs, Nuclear-specific, Oil, diversified, etc.

## Reshoring / Domestic Manufacturing 🏭

**Why it works:** Supply chain fragility exposed by COVID + Ukraine war driving European "strategic autonomy." EU Chips Act ($47B) and Critical Raw Materials Act forcing manufacturing repatriation. Populist governments accelerate this trend with "economic nationalism." European reshoring market growing 5.2% CAGR, with particular strength in semiconductors, pharmaceuticals, and critical components.

**Political alignment:** Both left (jobs, unions) and right (sovereignty, security) support reshoring. Rare bipartisan momentum.

**Risk:** Capital-intensive with 3-5 year payback periods. Execution risk high.

---

## Data Centres / Digital Infrastructure 🏢

**Why it works:** European data centre market exploding from $37B (2024) to $95B (2033) at 11.2% CAGR. AI compute demand + data sovereignty laws (GDPR, Digital Markets Act) forcing hyperscalers to build locally. Microsoft, Google, Amazon committing €20B+ each to European infrastructure by 2028. Edge computing and 5G rollout create additional density requirements.

**Multiplier effect:** Each data centre creates demand for power, cooling, real estate, and fibre connectivity.

**Edge:** Picks-and-shovels play on AI boom without picking tech winners.

## Critical Minerals & Mining ⛏️

**Why it works:** Green transition requires 6x more minerals than fossil fuels. EU imports 97% of rare earths, 93% of lithium, 71% of cobalt—mostly from China. Critical Raw Materials Act targets 40% domestic processing by 2030. Populist or not, physics demands these materials for batteries, wind turbines, EVs, and defence systems.

**Scarcity premium:** 15-20 year lead times on new mines means supply cannot quickly respond to demand.

**Political catalyst:** Trade wars and China tensions accelerate strategic stockpiling and domestic sourcing urgency.

**Risk:** Commodity price volatility and heavy regulatory/environmental approval hurdles in Europe.
