# HMRC Connect:

The Connect database brought in £4.6 billion in 2024-25, a 35% jump on its usual yearly total of £3.4 billion. Connect works by pulling together information from different sources and linking it to spot patterns and possible tax problems that humans alone would struggle to detect.

Connect integrates information from various sources: bank records, property data, company filings, social media, e-commerce sites, cryptocurrency exchanges, and sharing economy platforms. It accesses data from tax authorities worldwide through information-sharing agreements. [Tax Accountant](https://www.taxaccountant.co.uk/how-hmrc-connect-system-tracks-tax-affairs/)

Connect has two main parts: the analytical compliance environment (ACE), which lets specialist staff manipulate and analyse data in a hunt for discrepancies, and the integrated compliance environment (ICE), which presents links between data in a pictorial way to help analysts spot discrepancies between declared and other data.
