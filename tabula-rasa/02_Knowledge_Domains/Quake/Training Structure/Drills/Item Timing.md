# Item Timing Drills:

## Foundations - Working with Zero Pressure:

**Goal:** Build up compute time to calculate times in head, track multiple variables at once.
**Secondary Goal:** Build up a feeling how long it takes to get to each item, get better at understanding the routes in the map.

- **Level 1:** Time the MH in an empty server.
	- **Success Threshold:** Calculate timing within 3 seconds, for 10 minutes, with 100% accuracy, for 3 sessions.
- **Level 2:** Time the RA in an empty server.
	- **Success Threshold:** Calculate timing within 3 seconds, for 10 minutes, with 100% accuracy, for 3 sessions.
- **Level 3:** Time the RA and MH in an empty server.
	- **Success Threshold:** Calculate timing within 3 seconds, for 10 minutes, with 95% accuracy, for 3 sessions.
- **Level 4:** Time the RA, YA, MH in an empty server.
	- **Success Threshold:** Calculate timing within 3 seconds, for 10 minutes, with 90% accuracy, for 3 sessions.
- **Level 5:** Time the RA, YA, GA, MH in an empty server.
	- **Success Threshold:** Calculate timing within 3 seconds, for 10 minutes, with 85% accuracy, for 3 sessions.

**Level Regression:** If accuracy drops below 60% on any level, drop back down a level, repeat session and then re-attempt current level.
**Module Success**: Can time items when spectating, watching demos, or practice servers automatically.

## Beginner - Operating Under Low Pressure:

**Goal:** Build up tolerance to pressure, learning to count whilst fighting.

**Level 6:** Time the MH against a bot
**Level 7:** Time the RA against a bot
**Level 8:** Time the RA and MH against a bot
**Level 9:** Time the RA, YA, MH against a bot
**Level 10:** Time the RA, YA, GA, MH against a bot

## Intermediate - Operating Normally:

Goal: Operate in real match settings against an opponent.

**Level 11:** Time the MH against an opponent
**Level 12:** Time the RA against an opponent
**Level 13:** Time the RA and MH against an opponent
**Level 14:** Time the RA, YA, MH against an opponent
**Level 15:** Time the RA, YA, GA, MH against an opponent

## Advanced:

Goal: Operate in a real match, but figure out how to contest or listen to items.

**Level 16:** Figure out how to position against an opponent for MH
**Level 17:** Figure out how to position against an opponent for RA
**Level 18:** Figure out how to position against an opponent for MH/RA
**Level 19:** Figure out how to position against an opponent for MH/RA/YA
**Level 20:** Figure out how to position against an opponent for MH/RA/YA/GA
