# Practice Menu

## Mechanics
### Movement
- Strafe jumping fundamentals (empty server, specific routes)
- Circle jumping (starts, transitions)
- Air control drills (threading tight spaces)
- Map-specific movement lines (speed routes per map)
- Trick jumps library (advanced shortcuts)

### Aim
- LG tracking (bot, tracking maps, duelling focus)
	- LG ANTILAG servers
- RG flick accuracy (static targets, moving targets)
- RL prediction (ground shots, air shots, splash damage)
- Projectile leading (plasma, grenades)
- Weapon switching speed drills
- Aim Training

### Combat Application
- LG duel practice (isolated weapon scenarios)
- Clan Arena practice
  - IZI Pubs: RG and spam priority
  - Other servers: LG and 1v1 focus
- Weapon priority drills (when to switch, punish windows)
- Damage optimization (maximizing DPS per encounter)

## Game Sense
### Timing & Control
- Item timing drills (current progression system)
- Stack management practice (when to take damage, when to run)
- Map control scenarios (establishing dominance positions)
- Spawn prediction drills (where opponent spawns, where to position)

### Positioning
- Angle holding practice (defensive positions per map)
- Rotation patterns (major item loops)
- Escape route drilling (bail-out plans when low)
- Sound positioning (using audio for info, hiding your audio)

### Decision Making
- Risk assessment scenarios (fight vs flee drills)
- Economy decisions (ammo management, when to use RL vs conserve)
- Comeback mechanics (down in stack/score, how to claw back)

## Analysis
### Self Review
- Demo review (your matches - identify 1 error type per session)
- Training log analysis (pattern recognition in your failures)
- Stat tracking (accuracy %, damage efficiency, control time %)

### Learning from Others
- Pro player analysis (how they approach specific maps/matchups)
- Tournament VOD study (meta strategies, new techniques)
- Community resources (guides, timing sheets, positioning videos)

## Integration
### Constrained Practice
- Duel with only timing focus (mechanics on autopilot)
- Duel with only mechanics focus (ignore items, just fight)
- Duel with only positioning focus (stay alive, control space)
- Restricted weapon duels.
	- Try win without without one of the big three. (LG, RL, RG)

### Full Application
- Ranked/competitive duels (everything together)
- Scrims vs practice partners (testing specific strats)
- Tournament prep (map pool focus, matchup study)

## Maintenance & Recovery
### Low Intensity
- Casual pub play (fun, low stakes)
- Spectating high-level matches (passive learning)
- Theory crafting (route planning, timing math)
- Community engagement (asking questions, discussion)

### Physical Support
- Warmup routines (wrist/hand stretches, posture check)
- Cooldown protocols (eye breaks, hand recovery)
- Setup optimization (Sens testing, crosshair tweaking)
