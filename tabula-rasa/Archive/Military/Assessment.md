# Assessment:

- Figure out what job role you want. Ask staff about job roles and what they've done or if they know about anyone doing X or Y.
	- Also talk to your mates about the same things, they can have insight, and if you talk with them for a bit, you'll build a bit of a rapport.
	- e.g. Why are you trying to join the army? What job do you want? What are you most excited about?, etc.
- Practice the psychometric tests in advance, you want to give yourself the best chance possible to score high and not be limited by them in any way.
