# Job Role:

## Operator Technical Intelligence (OPTI):

This by far sounds like the most interesting role to me.

## Communications Engineer

### Description:

Joining the Royal Signals as a [Communications Engineer](https://jobs.army.mod.uk/roles/royal-signals/cyber-engineer/?cid=refe8706253943) gives you the choice of three different specialisations down the line.

1. Network Engineer - Build and maintain networks and communication systems. Make sure they run well.
2. Information Services Engineer - Manage and deploy software that are needed for operational communication. Ensure that people can get the information they need to perform.
3. Communications Infrastructure Engineer - Physically build physical and digital infrastructure.

For me **Network Engineer** and **Information Services Engineer** Sound the most interesting since you can pivot into cyber security after learning the basics. You also can work at the software layer more, which is easier and safer.

I think network engineer is best, since you have a lot of overlap and opportunities to meet and help different people, it also seems like the most likely where you aren't going to get pigeonholed into doing a boring role, if you gain skills and qualifications you'll get paid more and get more opportunities.
