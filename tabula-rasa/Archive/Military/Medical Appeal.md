# Medical Appeal:

My main motivation is that I was inspired by a few friends and people who I've met who were in the armed forces. Everyone who I've met who has been affiliated with the military has been a really solid and respectful person. The way they seemed to carry themselves was different, which I respected then, and then I came to the realisation that I wanted to be like that.

Ultimately, I have an interest in joining the army because I want to do something greater than myself, to actually go out there and make a meaningful positive change in the world. I do believe that I have a large sense of duty, justice, and responsibility towards others. I want to uphold the positive values that strengthen people and organisations.

I'm approaching this with a large amount of grit and determination; I'm willing to go through anything and I'm set to do anything, even if it is as benign as cleaning floors. I am specialised and interested in technology and computers. But if there is anything that needs to be done for the world or for the people who matter to me, I'll work towards it with a high standard.

On the topic of my medical appeal, I have struggled with depression in the past, but it is something that I've worked on through physical exercise and routine, which have helped me the most - more than therapeutic sessions or even medication - which I know that the army values greatly, which I also value greatly. I frequently do resistance training, cross-trained with cardiovascular training - nothing makes me feel better than an hour or so run where I really push myself. I've been training for the past month to cross the largest glacier in Europe, the Vatnajokull Glacier in Iceland.

In closing, I understand that there are procedures and guidelines in place not only for the protection of individuals, but for the protection of groups and organisations. That as I am currently, the risk may just be too high, if that is the case. What are the aspects that I could work on to improve my chances in the future and what would you be looking for?

All the best,
Alex.
