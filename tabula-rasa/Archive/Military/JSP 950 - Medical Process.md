# JSP 950 - Medical Process:

## Getting Accepted:

You'll only be accepted USUALLY if you are fully medically fit to be deployed. Unless relevant personnel appeal for you.

If I show all my evidence, I could get an S2, but probably an S3 pass and be MLD. Once treatment is done and I've tapered down, I'd likely move to an S2.

## Psychiatry In-service:

If you take anti-depressants, then you are automatically MLD (Medically Limited Deployment) with restrictions.

During most clinical assessments, no mental capacity is required. But, after completing basic training, or after illness or injury - then full psychometric tests are conducted by a specialist.

To be MFD (Medically Fully Deployable), you need to be able to:
1. Deploy at short notice word-wide
2. High degree of certainty that they can cope during deployment
3. Deploy away from support network without being admin burden or operational risk.
4. Deploy without the need for specialist support
5. Relapse must not pose high risk.

Clinicians consider the following factors:
1. The level of hardship that the individual will be likely to encounter.
2. Level of medical support required
3. Duties to be performed and the level of training and experience of duties.
4. Current welfare of the individual.
5. Do symptoms negatively effect concentration, sleep, judgement, impulsivity, attitude, morale, and/or motivation.
6. How fast they can break down.
7. The degree of insight that the person has into their condition.
8. The safety critical tasks.

CMD or common mental disorders can result in you being downgraded in the system. They do stepped care. in that:
1. Initial Intervention (No limit)
	1. No psychotherapeutic intervention, self-help resources and such.
2. Low intensity Therapy (6-10 sessions)
	1. Weekly sessions of standardised, mild therapy.
3. High intensity therapy (12-30 sessions)
	1. Qualified specialist for severe presentations
4. Complex case management (long-term care)
	1. Multiple professionals, you are unfit for military service.

Any person who is undergoing care for CMD beyond level 1, will be graded as MND (Medically Not Deployable), you can get a wavier for levels beyond that but it is rare. To go back to CMD, you need to be stable for a month and complete treatment.

Permanent Grade changes occur by the Medical Board and clinicians:
- MND if the following occurs
	- Maximum amount of therapy sessions with issue not being resolved
	- 2 trials of antidepressants with no improvement
	- They aren't able to stay stable enough to pursue treatment after 6 months.
	- If the psychiatrist states the risk of relapse is too high.
	- Psychosis, Bipolar, Personality disorders
	- Re-entering care within 3 years after treatment if they don't respond to treatment quickly.
		- Still can have a role that is lower risk.
	- Self harm
	- Mental health ward with more than 3 repeats or greater than 56 days
