# Idea:

Have the MC be a young person in university trying to get into a relationship, have everything start off fine, but gradually hint at darker themes through the different options. Culminating in a horror experience.

**Typical Tropes in dating sims:**
- Caring and kind baker who is secretly sadistic and is manipulating and drugging the MC
	- Gradually the dosage added or increased over time.
	- Culminating in kidnapping and force-feeding
- Fitness gal who builds up the MCs confidence, encouraging, and supportive. But starts controlling MC and the player psychologically, breaking them down.
	- Trying to shift the MC away from friends to focus on fitness or other "healthier goals"
- Harmless Nerdy girl who plays victim that manipulated MC and the player through guilt, obligation, and the desire to be helpful.
	- Get's the MC to take care of them through artificial dependency

I want to explore what male sexual abuse would look like through the visual novel medium, using horror to raise awareness about overlooked member in society.

I also really like making stories that sicken people to their core.

- Unreliable narration, where what the MC sees is different to what outsiders see. Where concern is masked.
- Have normal characters that don't match what the MC is perceiving.
- Highlight text and transform text to build trust or misdirect the player.

Indications of things going wrong:
- Gradually change the players control to be more passive and limited.
- Blend the manipulation with regular relationship growth.
- Have physical symptoms that can be explained by stress from school.
- Things being moved slightly
- Love interests saying strange things that don't match with what the player knows.
- Camera or text suggests another viewpoint


Route endings:
- Acceptance
	- Moving through in a dissociative state
- Escape
	- Free, but struggling from invisible scars
- Failed Escape
	- Hopelessness and futility as the MC is eroded over time.

Short but sweet endings.
You need to build the players trust them subvert it.

Write the same conversation twice
Practice subtext - characters mean the opposite of what they say.
Character voice consistency - Write main characters in different situations.
Unreliable narrator - where the narrator misunderstands what is happening
