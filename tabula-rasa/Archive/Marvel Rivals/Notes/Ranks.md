# Ranks

How long will it take for me to get each rank? Assuming 21 hours per week.

## Ranked Progression Estimate:

Assuming that climbing each rank gets progressively harder as you climb more. You lose less elo for SVP. I do think you gain slightly more elo for good stats. You can stat pad in lost games.

## Main - HAXEL:
Grandmaster 1 - Level 24 - 31.1 hours
### Support - Healix:
Grandmaster 2 -  level 25 - 34.4 hours
### Support - Yanggodgirl:
Grandmaster 2 - level 24 - 30.2 hours
### Tank - Zensys:
Grandmaster 3 - level 26 - 40.5 hours
### DPS - AxelG:
Grandmaster 3 -  Level 19 - 18.8 hours
