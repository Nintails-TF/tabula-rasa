# Focus Notes:

**29/05/25** - Keep water next to desk, stay within playing boundaries, sleep and recovery is necessary for growth too. Not just spamming games, even if it is the quicker route, it is unsustainable.
**30/05/25** - Learning the new patch, what heroes are going to be good this season and what isn't going to be good.
**31/05/25** - Getting better at tanking. Looking at kill feed and being aware, using this to either push or back off.
