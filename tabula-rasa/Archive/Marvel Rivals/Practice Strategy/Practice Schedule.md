## **Daily Weekday Routine (3 Hours Total)**

### **Phase 1: Preparation (15 minutes)**

- **Physical Setup:** Proper posture, hydration, comfortable temperature
- **Mental Preparation:** 2-3 deep breaths, review today's focus goal
- **Session Goal Setting:** Write down ONE specific area to work on today
    - Examples: "Focus on crosshair placement in duels" or "Work on last-hitting under pressure"

### **Phase 2: Mechanics Drills (30 minutes)**

- **Consistency is Key:** Same routine every day
- **Game-Specific Examples:**
    - **FPS:** Aim trainer (15 min) + movement practice (15 min)
    - **MOBA:** Last-hit trainer (15 min) + combo practice (15 min)
- **Track Progress:** Note daily scores/times in a simple spreadsheet
- **No Exceptions:** Do this even when tired - builds discipline

### **Phase 3: Focused Gameplay (2 hours)**

- **Pre-Game Ritual:** Review today's focus area, take a moment to visualize success
- **During Games:**
    - Actively practice the chosen technique
    - Make callouts to yourself about good/bad executions
    - Take 30-second breaks between games to process what happened
- **Documentation:** Quick voice notes or text file with key moments
    - "Game 3: Great crosshair placement in mid fight led to 3K"
    - "Game 5: Tunnel vision cost me map awareness - work on this"

### **Phase 4: Immediate Review (45 minutes)**

- **Cool Down First:** 5-minute break, walk around, hydrate
- **Game Selection:** Pick your best game and worst game from the session
- **Review Process:**
    - **Good Game (20 min):** What did you do right? How can you replicate it?
    - **Bad Game (20 min):** What went wrong? What was the root cause?
- **Action Items:** Write 1-2 specific things to work on tomorrow

### **Tilt Management Protocol**

- **Recognition Signs:** Increased heart rate, negative self-talk, blaming teammates
- **Immediate Action:** Stop gaming, go lift weights or run for 20-30 minutes
- **Return Condition:** Only resume if you feel genuinely reset, not just "less angry"
- **Alternative:** End session early - protecting mental state is more important than completing routine

## **Mental Game Integration**

### **Daily Mental Practices**

- **Confidence Building:** Start each session by reviewing recent successes
- **Pressure Training:** Occasionally practice with stakes (rank, tournament modes)
- **Opponent Psychology:** Note what tactics tilt you, develop counters
- **Self-Talk Management:** Replace "I'm bad" with "I'm learning"

### **Sustainability Safeguards**

- **Burnout Recognition:** Missing practice doesn't feel like relief, it feels like obligation
- **Health Non-Negotiables:** Sleep 7+ hours, exercise 3x/week, maintain social connections
- **Work Performance:** If gaming impacts job performance, immediately scale back
- **Relationship Check:** Regular conversations with family/friends about balance

### **Seasonal Adjustments**

- **High-Stress Work Periods:** Reduce to mechanics + 1 hour gameplay
- **Tournament Seasons:** Add extra weekend sessions
- **Life Events:** Permission to completely pause without guilt
- **Vacation Time:** Option to do gaming bootcamp or complete disconnect

## **Success Metrics**

- **Skill Progression:** Monthly rank/rating improvements
- **Consistency:** Maintaining routine 5+ days per week
- **Life Balance:** Work performance stable, relationships healthy
- **Enjoyment:** Still having fun after 6 months of routine

**Remember:** This routine serves you, not the other way around. Adjust intensity based on life circumstances, and always prioritize long-term sustainability over short-term gains.
