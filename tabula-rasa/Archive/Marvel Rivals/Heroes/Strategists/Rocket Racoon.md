# Rocket Racoon - Notes:

- He's great at teaching the game, as you have a simple kit, so you can devote brainpower to reading the game and other aspects.
- BRB is great on defence, since it enables a death to not have a long spawn and walk to the fight, he negates pressure indirectly with his BRB.
- His gun isn't the best beyond destroying buildable or using it as a get off me/my support tool, you usually just want to spam healing.
- You can play below a ledge and bait a dive/dash, then you can counter dash up to height.
	- For this reason, and his passive, it is worth playing somewhat close to walls.
- You don't want to dash without a reason, there are sometimes when you'll need the two dashes to live, so don't burn dashes unless the fight is 100% won already.
- It becomes a lot harder to focus on ult tracking, if you are being hard dived.
	- Very small mistakes can have a massive butterfly effect and lose you games and series.
