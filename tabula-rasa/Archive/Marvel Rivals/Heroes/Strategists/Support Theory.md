# Theory:


You want to keep the people on your team alive. You can do this through healing, damage, or mitigation. 

How do you keep your team alive.

1. Keep your other support alive.
2. Only use resources when you need to.
3. Track what resources have been used.
	1. Ult tracking
4. Use cover and positioning to avoid being killed.
5. Knowing when to heal VS damage.

You win the game as support, by not using your ultimate unless your team needs it. This means that when other ults are popped, you have to decide in that moment if you are going to use your ult or not.

You can throw the game by using your ult, just in the future. But you can also let your team die and have them flame you. So it's tough.
