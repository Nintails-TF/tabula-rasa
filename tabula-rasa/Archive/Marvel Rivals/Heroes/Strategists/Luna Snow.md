# Luna Snow - Notes:

- Ensure that you keep your other support topped off whenever possible.
- Always check if you need to pop a support ult or not.
	- Keep your ult for high value offensive tools.
		- Spidey, Groot, Starlord, etc ults
- Keep range from Emma, she murders you at close range if she gets in beam range.
- Best way to prevent a flank is to scout ahead of time, then poke them out and adjust positioning.
- You can save snowball for the thing at the end of his charge or start-up of his ult.
- Save your clap, for big fights when people are grouped up, don't use it for no reason.
