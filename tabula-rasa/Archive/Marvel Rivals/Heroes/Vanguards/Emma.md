- Silence ult can hit you through the cart.
- Wait until the 3rd hit before doing a kick or grab to maximise damage.
- Give yourself a little bit of time before grabbing after swapping to diamond form.
- Ults you can diamond form
	- Thing
	- Groot
	- Wolverine
	- Jeff
- Ults you can cancel with grab
	- Psylocke
	- Magneto
	- Wanda
	- Spiderman
	- 
- Even if you flash someone for a little bit, you can cancel their ult.
