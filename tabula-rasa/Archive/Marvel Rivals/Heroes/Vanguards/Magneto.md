# Magneto

- Things you can block
	- Strange Ult
	- Wanda Ult
	- Magneto Ult
- If you want to try one-shot a squishy, you can shoot, right-click (mag-cannon), shoot.
	- Make sure you walk forward a little when doing this. After you pushback.
- If you right click, you are stuck in animation and can't shield for a while. Ensure you are able to block ults.
- Loki can block you meteor M with his lamp!
- Ultron and punisher can burn through your meteor quickly.
- You need to be careful of ceilings and lips that can block your ult.
