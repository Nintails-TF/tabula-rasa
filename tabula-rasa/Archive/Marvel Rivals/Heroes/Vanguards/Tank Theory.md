# Theory:

You want to draw eyes and resources away from the rest of your team. You can do this, because you have a large HP pool, CC, shields, etc.

You have less damage than duellists/DPS and you don't have the sustain that strategists/supports can provide.

The question then is, how do you achieve this?

1. Winning the tank vs tank.
	1. Better resource management.
2. Diving the opponents backline/squishies.
3. Peeling for your squishies.
4. Splitting attention or creating crossfires.
	1. Angular pressure/Triangulation.
5. Countering ultimates

A tank who is great can lose to a tank who is bad, if their supports can compensate for it. Since the bad tank will use resources worse then the good tank, but they'll have more HP and resources from their supports that the great tank will not get. In this case, the great tank has to work with what they have and play slower/more passive as the healing/peel isn't there.
