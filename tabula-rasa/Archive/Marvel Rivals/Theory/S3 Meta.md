# S3 Meta

## Drafting:

Luna and Hawkeye are going to be the big ban targets. The tankline should still be things like Emma + Mag mainly. Hela, Starlord, Wolverine will likely be premier DPS picks beyond Hawk.

Ultron will see bans early on because he is new. He feels pretty tough to play against and interact with.
Peni bans? - 2 beacons is really strong.
	Storm bans to stop sharknado killing everyone. 

Storm (Assuming a Hawk ban) -> Storm/Hawk if unbanned -> Punisher/Iron Man/Peni/Whatever

## Meta Picks:

### Duellists:

| Hero Name                     | Good Matchups                                     | Bad Matchups                                              | Reasoning                                                                                                                                          |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Hela**                      |                                                   |                                                           | Same as Namor, but less broken, has a very strong ult that your team has to respect.                                                               |
| **Starlord**                  |                                                   |                                                           | Only played in the res comp. Ridiculous if his team builds around him, Magneto bubbles + res is very very oppressive.                              |
| Iron Man (If Ultron is good)  | Immobile heroes, projectile heroes, melee heroes. | Hela, Hawkeye, Punisher, Hulk (OTP), Magneto, Luna, Adam, | Similar to human torch but more manageable. Much better with Hulk teamup, so ban or use Hulk.                                                      |
| Iron Fist                     |                                                   | C&D, Loki, Rocket,                                        | Insane damage output and mobility, can blow up whole teams if played well menace to tanks. Kind of for OTPs.                                       |
| Spiderman                     |                                                   | C&D, Loki, Rocket,                                        | Insane damage output and mobility, can blow up whole teams if played well menace to supports. Only for OTPs, he sucks if you aren't sweaty on him. |
| Wolverine                     | Groot, Strange, Peni, Magneto                     | Iron man, Human torch, Storm, Psylocke, Invisible Woman   | Sometimes played in a solo tank comp. Works as a pick hero, ult does WAY too much damage too quickly, melts people.                                |
| Punisher (If his gun is good) |                                                   |                                                           | Only played with rocket teamup. Can shred tanks from midrange with the gun boost, can shred with his ult.                                          |
| Bucky (Winter Soldier)        |                                                   |                                                           | Not as good as other picks, but strong in high elo/smurf ult resets can kill your whole team and hook can secure and playmaker for kills.          |
| Storm                         |                                                   |                                                           |                                                                                                                                                    |
