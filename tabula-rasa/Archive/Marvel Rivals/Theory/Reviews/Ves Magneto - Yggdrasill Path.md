# Ves Magneto - Yggdrasill Path:

- Walks up to cart and doesn't use CDs until needed. Just shoots out damage.
	- Reloading when rotation from position to position.
- If he gets chunked, first operation is the use the self shield barrier.
- Bubble the person who is doing things, If that's you, it's you.
	- Assuming there isn't an ultimate threat.
- In regards to ultimate's, you just have to trust your supports to use sustain ultimate's in fights.
- When fighting Emma, you can walk forward and block the crystal.
- You can try meteor M bucky after he falls from his ult.
	- It's OK to miss ults. 
- When dealing with another magneto, you want to wait on reaction to his meteor M, you can't just shield the whole thing, like a strange could.
- He's always jumping and sort of shooting down.
- He has no fear and will just take space if it's not being contested right away.
- If you lose 1 with no compensation, or if you lose 2, the fight is lost and you need to leave.
- He uses the Emma teamup a lot to chase or secure picks.
- He goes for hard Meteor Ms, like hitting storms or cloak and daggers.
	- You can ult C&D in the intervals between dashes, like the 3rd dash for example.
	- Going for storm when she is ulting is also strong as fuck.
- The second he gets a pick or advantage, he goes deep.
- His knockback pulse is being used as either one of 3 things.
	- A poke tool
	- In a combo, to land an extra shot during a fight.
	- As a finisher to deal the final blow.
- Saving bubbles for your teammates who are ulting is INSANE VALUE.
- Meteor M can't one shot magneto, so he saves his ulting luna snow.

**The reason why you lose games on tank, is because you either overextend and get greedy with taking space. Or you use resources poorly.**
