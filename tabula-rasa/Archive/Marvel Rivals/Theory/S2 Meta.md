# Season 2 Meta Overview:
## Drafting:

S2 - As of right now, fliers are too strong (Human Torch and Iron Man). So you want to weaken Iron man by banning hulk to prevent him from getting stronger and gamma squids do so much damage, it is a broken team up.

If you aren't banning hulk, you need to ban groot, since his frontlining and slicing the field is too strong, he can cut of LOS from healers a blow up tanks and has a game changing ult.

**Bans are: Groot -> Hulk -> Human Torch -> Whatever fucks your team (Wolverine, Iron Fist/Spidey, Cap, Target Bans)**

Of course if your team wants to play groot/hulk then don't ban them.

### Duellists:

| Hero Name              | Good Matchups                                     | Bad Matchups                                              | Reasoning                                                                                                                                                                            |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Human Torch            | Immobile heroes, projectile heroes, melee heroes. | Hela, Hawkeye, Punisher, Hulk (OTP), Magneto, Luna, Adam, | Very difficult to interact with and take down, unless your team builds around it, but you'd weaken yourself in other aspects. Can be very oppressive if given lots of resources too. |
| Iron Man               | Immobile heroes, projectile heroes, melee heroes. | Hela, Hawkeye, Punisher, Hulk (OTP), Magneto, Luna, Adam, | Similar to human torch but more manageable. Much better with Hulk teamup, so ban or use Hulk.                                                                                        |
| Psylocke               | Chances everyone                                  | Torch, Iron man,                                          | Insane damage output with Emma teamup and incredible ult and very slippy and hard to kill.                                                                                           |
| Iron Fist              |                                                   | C&D, Loki, Rocket,                                        | Insane damage output and mobility, can blow up whole teams if played well menace to tanks. Kind of for OTPs.                                                                         |
| Spiderman              |                                                   | C&D, Loki, Rocket,                                        | Insane damage output and mobility, can blow up whole teams if played well menace to supports. Only for OTPs, he sucks if you aren't sweaty on him.                                   |
| Namor                  |                                                   |                                                           | Only with Hulk Teamup. Gamma squid is broken, he's very hard to kill and can access highground and does good midrange damage.                                                        |
| Wolverine              | Groot, Strange, Peni, Magneto                     | Iron man, Human torch, Storm, Psylocke, Invisible Woman   | Sometimes played in a solo tank comp. Works as a pick hero, ult does WAY too much damage too quickly, melts people.                                                                  |
| Hela                   |                                                   |                                                           | Same as Namor, but less broken, has a very strong ult that your team has to respect.                                                                                                 |
| Starlord               |                                                   |                                                           | Only played in the res comp. Ridiculous if his team builds around him, Magneto bubbles + res is very very oppressive.                                                                |
| Punisher               |                                                   |                                                           | Only played with rocket teamup. Can shred tanks from midrange with the gun boost, can shred with his ult.                                                                            |
| Bucky (Winter Soldier) |                                                   |                                                           | Not as good as other picks, but strong in high elo/smurf ult resets can kill your whole team and hook can secure and playmaker for kills.                                            |
