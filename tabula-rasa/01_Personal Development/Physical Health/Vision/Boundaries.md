# Boundaries:

- If it's bedtime, I'm going to bed. Unless something earthshattering is going on, it can wait until tomorrow.
	- I need my sleep and routine so that I don't start sleeping in and getting more depressed.
- I'm not consuming any drugs, alcohol, video games, social media.
	- These things just hurt me more than anything else.
	- I'll use youtube for music or learning exclusively. If a channel or video doesn't help me do these things, it's a waste of time.
- The bed is for sleeping only.
	- I'll make an exception for listening to things like audiobooks, podcasts, meditations, relaxing sounds, etc.
- Have as little expectations as possible, do things just for the sake of doing them.
	- Having sky high expectations of myself just makes me frustrated when I don't reach them. I need to temper my standards and just accept things for how they are.
- I'm only consuming sugar or caffeine for strategic purposes, not pleasure.
- I'm the most important person in my world.
	- It isn't that other people aren't valuable, it is just the case that I have to value and respect myself, because nobody else will if I don't.
