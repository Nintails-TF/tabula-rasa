# Introduction:

Let's suggest that we are looking for success in a given domain (career, relationship, craft, health, etc). What is the fundamental process of improving at any of these domains?

The main ideas and concepts I will address are as followed:

1. Core Optimisation
	1. Within this vision idea, this is the **physical** and **mental** factors.
2. Lifestyle Optimisation
	1. Within this vision idea, this is the **environmental**, **psychological**, and **social** factors. 
3. Domain Optimisation
	1. Getting good at the thing you care about by setting SMART goals.
4. Review/Reflection
	1. Are you meeting the goal that you've set? If not change something.
5. Repetitions
	1. If you are succeeding in what you do, then keep doing it until it is automatic.
6. Maintenance
	1. Once it is automatic, devote a smaller chunk of time to maintain the skill from time to time.
