# Step 1 - Clean up Your Act:

Your physical environment reflects your inner state of mind. This is also true about your appearance.

# Step 2 - Lessen the Screen Time:

Scrolling and going on your phone less helps out a ton. Change environments to help you avoid distractions.

# Step 3 - Try out Healthy Habits

# Step 4 - Figure out what You want

Have two goals for each domain of your life, have a ceiling goal and a floor goal.

# Step 5 - Building a Schedule

Your life is made up out of the monotonous days. Figure out what your normal boring days look like.

# Step 6 - Actually Doing what You'll Say You'll Do:

Build evidence and confidence through setting goals and achieving them. Be nice to yourself in the process and do what you said you will do.

# Step 7 - Consistency Over Everything:

Intensity cannot out work consistency. Doing something smaller each day is better than grinding like hell for a single day.

# Step 8 - Reflecting on the Progress:

Once you drag yourself out of the pit, figure out things that have changed and stayed the same.
