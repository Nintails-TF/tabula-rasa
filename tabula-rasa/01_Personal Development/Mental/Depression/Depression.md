# Depression:

*I believe that the reason why I feel the need to die, is because I'm very unhappy with the way my life is going, but I don't believe in myself to make the changes necessary to put my life on a better path.*

It is possible for anybody to change who they are if they aren't happy with themselves, it isn't easy and it isn't always quick, but change can happen.

When you have an addiction, and you try to quit, but then you fail. quit and fail over and over. You stop believing that you can make any sort of change.

## The Role of Physical Activity on Mental Health

Physical activity plays a large role in alleviating symptoms of mental health disorders. With the following domains being affected:

1. **Physical activity improves sleep quality.**
	1. Multiple reasons for this ranging from: anxiety reduction, mood improvement, temperature regulation, and neurotransmitter balance.
	2. Morning exercise can shift night owls to earlier bedtimes.
		1. Light exposure supresses melatonin and wakes the brain up. Then adenosine is built up quicker in the day, inducing feelings of tiredness.
		2. 10-15 minutes of something light can really help. With this taking 2-3 weeks usually.
	3. Time taken to fall asleep is reduced, deep sleep is increased, daytime sleepiness is reduced, leg discomfort is lower.
		1. All around, physical exercise is amazing for sleep.
2. **Physical exercise improves HPA (hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal) axis function.** [^1]
	1. This results in a reduction in cortisol levels and restores balance of leptin and ghrelin, so the gut plays a very important role in mental health.
		1. 90% of serotonin is produced in the stomach.
		2. The vagus nerve is the highway between the digestive systems and the brain. 
			1. *VNS treatment for treatment-resistant depression highlights how this connection is very real.*
		3. Inflammation in the gut can trigger neuroinflammation in the brain.
	2. For this reason, people who have gastrointestinal problems are at risk for mental disorders like depression/anxiety and vice versa.
3. **Physical exercise reduces cravings for substances.**
	1. For conditions like alcoholism, there is research that shows cravings can be reduced by 40% [^2]
	2. Could be for numerous reasons why:
		1. **Natural highs** - *Physical activity stimulates the endocannabinoid system, creating a natural high that can substitute for substance-induced states.*
			1. Think of "Runner's High"
		2. **Improved Executive Function** - *Exercise helps the prefrontal cortex, which enhances impulse control and decision making.*
		3. **Social Factors** - *Exercise classes, such as in the Swedish study, can provide positive social reinforcement, accountability, and support.*
 4. **Physical exercise can be as effective if not more effective than anti-depressants**

### Summary:

Physical exercise is a very important piece of the puzzle in improving quality of life and for fighting symptoms of anxiety, depression, and other mental disorders. This is done via neurological and biological changes that occur in the body.
