# Addiction

## Introduction:

I suppose that I feel pretty strongly that there are companies that profit off giving people these addictions by purposely making addictive products and using unsavoury techniques to get people hooked.

I always think of the example of Psychology Majors being hired by companies to help drive sales, or to design a gameplay system in a live service game. We have companies who exploit human brains and ruin lives to coat their pockets with gold.

I suppose the difference is, that in the past, games that people got addicted to were just that good. I think of Vanilla World of Warcraft for example, that game was designed and made so well, but not in a way to manipulate people. On the other hand, I see P2W Korean MMOs nowadays, that have Gatcha mechanics, Diablo Immortal, etc. These games are systematically designed to milk as much money and hook people as much as possible, without the game being really good.

It's obsession over quality VS an artificial obsession. Others have referred to this as [artificial and real dopamine.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qYann7hy0o) But the concept is the same.

**In reality, it is the addictions like alcohol, tobacco, and food which are the most dangerous, since they are a huge part of society. With the internet becoming an entrenched part in society.**

## The Spiral of Addiction:

The problem isn't really the medium or feeling dopamine/pleasure. But it is the spikes that cause problems - It's similar to the analogy of eating sweets/sugar all day, of course your energy levels are going to be shot and you won't have that baseline of energy that you need.

The alternative to this would be creating an environment, then sustaining it which leads to a stable level of pleasure and happiness. The human brain and biology isn't designed for huge amounts of stimulation, especially if that's repeated over and over again.

## Why do we not change?:

Often when we try to stop something instantly and go full cold turkey, we basically create the inverse curve of artificial pleasure, in that we feel terrible and endure for a few days or a week, then go back to old habits.

The trick is to remove one small thing that you can manage and sustain. Subtract the friction in your life.
# Gaming:

**What is my current stance of video games?**
*Personally, now that I'm in my 20s, I don't see the value of playing video games, I've burned myself out from them and I think that they are a waste of time. I do regret spending so much time playing games, and not going out and pursuing relationships or other hobbies. It isn't that they were wholly negative, but that the bad outweighed the good at a certain level of addiction.*

**Would I want my children to play video games?**
*If they are doing so in a moderated and healthy manner in combination with other activities, I wouldn't have a problem. The issue is that they are highly addictive, and they'll likely end up burning away a lot of time and authentic experience they could get elsewhere. So I wouldn't push them towards it, and I'd work on holding them accountable to not overplaying by practicing temperance and moderation in my own life and explaining the risks of extensive playing to them.*

# YouTube / Short Form Content / Social Media:

**What is my current stance of social media?**
*Having an instant messenger to your friends and family through tools like WhatsApp/Discord is great. Being able to listen to music whenever is also great. But beyond these things, they have no value, I guess as a sort of background noise or ambience, but it is just so unnecessary.*

**Would I want my children to spend time on youtube, or social media?**
*No, there isn't any value to them watching this kind of slop. Everyone online is farming for views, engagement, and clicks. If they have a favourite show, we can make some time for them to watch a show or movie. But the endless pool of the internet content, is just going to harm their ability to focus, concentrate, and will make daily life feel less fun for them.*
# Pornography:

**What is my stance on pornography?**
*It's a way to get the monkey brain sated, I don't like my usage of it because my sexual interests have become more deviant as I've been exposed to more pornography, which makes me feel disgusted with myself. It isn't something I want to continue long term.*

**Would I want my children to spend time on pornography?:**
*I understand that there will probably be a point in time when my kids do become teenagers and get horny, so they'll likely end up consuming this sort of thing. Similar stance to video games, but it's even more highly addictive.*

# Alcohol:

**What is my stance on alcohol?:**
*I sort of don't get the buzz with it that everyone else seems to get, I just view it as a poison, that it doesn't help me reach my fitness goals, cognitive and learning goals, or anything who I want to be a person.*

**Would I want my children, when they are of legal age, to drink?**
*I'm not sure, if it is in moderation then I've got no problem with it, but people make the worst decisions in their lives after drinking too much alcohol and it can lead people down a dangerous path. But in moderation, if they drink during celebrations or are a social drinker, I don't see anything too wrong with that.*

# Smoking / Vaping

**What is my stance on smoking/vaping?:**
*Similar to alcohol, I don't see the benefit of taking on nicotine and weakening my lungs, heart, teeth, and breath. I suppose the difference with these harder substances is that you can see and feel the consequences of being addicted to them, unlike something digital or behavioural. Which makes it easier for me to refute it.*

**Would I want my children, when they are of legal age, to smoke?**
*Again, it's similar to alcohol in this sense. But I think that nicotine is just far more chemically addictive then alcohol, it's much easier for someone to get hooked and end up pouring away money and their lifespan on it, so I'd say I would be more against it than drinking. I also find it very undesirable and unattractive.*
# Street Drugs

**What is my stance on drugs?:**
*Basically, if they don't provide more than they take away, I see no purpose in said drugs. Let's say that your job required you to take drugs e.g. pro athlete, then I'd understand, but for regular people, it's just another rabbit hole to fall down.*

**Would I want my children to consume drugs?**
*No.*
# Gambling

**What is my stance on gambling?:**
*Gambling is very degenerate, you can't get money quickly in any sort of regard, just because it isn't good for a person to get that high off a reward. It can ruin lives and provides nothing to enhancing lives. If done on a small scale for a purpose, e.g. buying lottery tickets to help fund a community or local project, I don't have a problem with it. But actual casino or online gambling is a hard pass.*

**Would I want my children to gamble?**
*No, it's just an irresponsible way to handle money.*
# Food Addiction / UPFs

**What is my stance on Food Addiction?:**
People should be eating as much whole food as possible and avoiding all of these processed snacks, products, etc. The human body isn't made to consume certain compounds in such high amounts. It is why a natural way of eating is best. Sometimes you can't avoid it though, if you are travelling for example.

**Would I want my children to have a food addiction?:**
*No, If they would want something sugary or sweet, I'd help them make something together, so they understand that if they want something nice, they've got to work for it. I wouldn't say no to them having sweets occasionally, but only for meaningful events. I just wouldn't buy them, no matter how many tantrums are thrown.*
