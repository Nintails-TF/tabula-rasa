# Inflammation:

Inflammation occurs when your body responds to harmful stimuli, injury, or infection.

**Acute inflammation** is the normal response, it occurs often in muscles or joints when we exercise or get injured, so it's local to the area of the body.

**Chronic Inflammation** is the harmful response, it is often low grade and occurs all over within the body for a longer period of time resulting in many health problems over time.

## Inflammation and Depression:

Chronic Inflammation and depression often go hand in hand, as they have evidence to suggest that they both feed of each other. With 30-50% of those who are depressed present with elevated inflammation markers, and those with inflammatory conditions (rheumatic arthritis, IBS, etc.) are at risk for depression.

The best way to deal with Chronic Inflammation is:
- Regular exercise
	- Aids in the production of helpful hormones and prevents excessive fat.
- Quality sleep (7-9 hours)
- Stress Management
- A strong diet
	- Whole foods with omega-3 fatty acids. Avoid processed foods, sugar, and processed meats.
