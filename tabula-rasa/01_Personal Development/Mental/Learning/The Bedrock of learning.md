# The Bedrock of Learning:

At the core of it all, learning is about **putting in the repetitions.** We have learning strategies which we can use in order to expedite the process, but if you don't put in the repetitions you will not get far.

Before we start to learn, it is key that we place ourselves in a place in which we are ready to learn. In a sense, an obese man doesn't go for an hour jog: he starts by walking a little more, then briskly walking, then walking/jogging, before running. 

**There is no need to be perfect**, but we have to be in a functional state. Keep that in mind when before you are harsh on yourself or procrastinate learning by trying to get everything just right.

## Pyramid of Learning

![[pyramid-of-learning.png]]
(*Based on my learning framework, see [[Framework Summary]])*

### Function of the Pyramid

The foundations of learning effectively relies on **taking care of body.** To first ensure that you actually have the physical requirements in place to participate in learning; then **taking care of the mind** to ensure that you aren't going to be distracted or disturbed when learning.

To reach the apex of learning, you'd then need to work on your cognitive functions and faculties. Put in lots of repetitions of those, and then boom! You're a domain specialist.

In essence, there are parts of this pyramid which are genetic or pre-determined. But anyone has the ability to become a better learner and enrich their life through knowledge and practice. Don't beat yourself up by calling yourself stupid, nor get entranced in narcissism by calling yourself intelligent. **Try to remain brutally honest with yourself.**

## Repetitions:

I believe the key aspect of doing any sort of repetition work, is to understand that mistakes or failures are part of the process. You'll feel sadness, frustration, hopelessness, fear, and a whole cocktail of various when exposed to failure. We deathly fear doing poorly.

> Reframe failure as a sign that things aren't working out, and figure out a new strategy.

I'd be more concerned if somebody wasn't making errors when learning. That would tell me that they aren't being challenged enough. **Csikszentmihalyi's** idea of flow is strong here. *If we are challenged too much we break and cannot comprehend, if we are challenged not enough we are bored and don't see mental adaptation*. **Goldilocks was right all along!**
