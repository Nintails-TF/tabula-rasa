# Hierarchy of Learning:
1. Physiological needs
2. Safety and Security needs
3. Cognitive Resources
4. Higher Order Function
   
Social needs and factors are helpful, but they are unreliable. If good opportunities arise you should take them, but not be dependant on these things.

Social factors accelerate because others can see in you what you are blind to.
# Physiological Needs:

## Sleep:
- Quantity: 7-9 hours consistently
- Sleep cycle regularity
- Deep sleep phases
- REM sleep quality
- Recovery indicators:
    - Morning alertness
    - Dream recall
    - Physical restoration
## Nutrition and Hydration:
- Blood sugar stability
- Meal timing and frequency
- Hydration levels
- Key nutrients:
    - Omega-3 fatty acids
    - B-vitamins
    - Protein adequacy
    - Micronutrient balance

## Physical Exercise:
- Exercise frequency
- Movement throughout day
- Cardiovascular health
- Physical tension/pain
- Energy levels
- Breathing patterns

## Hormonal Balance:
- Stress hormones (cortisol)
- Mood regulators (serotonin)
- Motivation chemicals (dopamine)
- Energy regulation (thyroid)
- Circadian rhythm function

***

# Safety and Security Needs:

## Physical Environment:
- Noise levels
- Light quality
- Air quality
- Temperature
- Ergonomics
- Space organization

## Psychological Safety:
- Freedom from immediate threats
- Financial security
- Housing stability
- Job security
- Social safety
- Cultural acceptance

## Emotional State:
- Stress levels
- Anxiety presence
- Emotional regulation
- Mood stability
- Relationship health

***

# Cognitive Resources:

## Attention System:
- Sustained focus capacity
- Distractibility level
- Task switching ability
- Environmental awareness
- Information filtering

## Mental Energy:
- Decision-making capacity
- Problem-solving stamina
- Creative resources
- Processing speed
- Recovery needs

## Working Memory:
- Information retention
- Multi-step processing
- Pattern recognition
- Connection-making
- Integration capacity

## Cognitive Load:
- Task complexity management
- Information processing demands
- Mental resource allocation
- Background process load
- Recovery status

***

# Higher Order Function:

## Motivation:
- Intrinsic drivers
- External motivators
- Goal clarity
- Value alignment
- Progress recognition

## Self-Efficacy Elements:
- Confidence levels
- Past success references
- Failure resilience
- Growth mindset
- Self-image

## Executive Function:
- Planning ability
- Organization skills
- Time management
- Priority setting
- Implementation strength

## Social Support:
- Mentorship access
- Peer learning opportunities
- Feedback channels
- Resource availability
- Community connection

***

## Assessment Questions for Each Level

### Level 1 Assessment:
- How is sleep quality affecting alertness and memory?
- Are nutrition patterns supporting or hindering cognitive function?
- Does physical activity level support learning capacity?
- Are there signs of hormonal imbalance impacting performance?

### Level 2 Assessment:
- Is the learning environment conducive to focus?
- Are there pressing security concerns consuming mental resources?
- How is emotional state affecting learning capacity?
- Is stress level manageable or overwhelming?

### Level 3 Assessment:
- Can sustained attention be maintained for required duration?
- Is mental energy sufficient for learning demands?
- How is working memory performing under current load?
- Are cognitive resources being effectively allocated?

### Level 4 Assessment:
- What is driving or hindering motivation?
- How is confidence affecting learning approach?
- Are executive functions supporting or limiting progress?
- Is social support system adequate for learning needs?

## Common Patterns and Interactions

### Success Patterns:
- Strong physiological foundation
- Stable environment
- Adequate cognitive resources
- Positive learning enablers
- Upward spiral of achievement

### Struggle Patterns:
- Sleep disruption → Reduced cognitive capacity
- Stress → Attention problems
- Poor nutrition → Energy fluctuation
- Low confidence → Reduced effort
- Downward spiral of difficulties

### Intervention Priorities:
1. Address foundational physiological needs first
2. Stabilize environment and safety factors
3. Manage cognitive resource allocation
4. Strengthen learning enablers
5. Monitor and adjust based on feedback
