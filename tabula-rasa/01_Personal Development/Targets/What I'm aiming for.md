# What I'm Aiming For:

## Prioritised List:

### Tier 1 - Foundational Skills:

**1. Physical Health:**
*This is non-negotiable and enables performance through any other domain, when you are physically strong, you not only feel better about yourself, but you cultivate more energy and potential. All other goals become easier.*

**2. Sleep and Recovery:**
*In a similar vein to physical health, sleep and giving yourself time to recover in an active manner provides a framework that hits everything and supports physical and mental performance.*

**3. Career Development:**
*I need money and resources so that I can invest time and resources into other areas of my life, so this requires daily attention. Cybersecurity isn't something I find amazingly fun but it is something that feels meaningful, helpful, and valuable to people and companies.*

### Tier 2 - Goals that Synergise Well:
#### Cluster 1 - Physical Development:
- Marathon Training + Lifting
	- *When programmed well, both can enhance each other.*
- Nutrition
	- *I need to ensure I'm getting the macros and micros I need for my body to function if I'm pushing it hard.*
- Recovery
	- *Again, things such as sleep and mental recovery play a role here.*
#### Cluster 2 - Mental Discipline:
- Chess/Video Games + Philosophy/Reading
	- *You have an intense problem solving and mental pursuit in the moment, and you have a slower, more methodical approach to problem solving and mental pursuits*
- Morning and Evening Routines
	- *Providing structure to each day, will increase discipline, eventually becoming automatic over time.*
- Trains emotional control - chess in particular, or solo eSports or solo-queue esports.
	- *The idea is to place oneself in environments that have an element of pressure that you can feel, but that the outcome of the matches don't really matter, so that performance under pressure can be cultivated. Thicker skin can also be developed.*
#### Cluster 3 - Social and Community:
- Running clubs and gym community
	- *Fitness communities and meeting others who are into fitness, positive helpful people in general.*
- Chess clubs/online communities
	- *Nerdy and autistic people who are very good at what they do and have vast knowledge about certain domains.*
- Language communities/exchanges
	- *Multi-cultural experiences, learning about other parts of the world and people. Gaining access to new bases of knowledge and perspectives.*

## Dealing with Distractions:

Note down any tasks or events that come up that demand additional attention. Figure out ways to get someone else to do them, or how to do them quickly and in a persistent manner, so that said task doesn't need to be completed again and again.

- Family chores and responsibilities.
	- Try get others to do these themselves, explain why you have to focus on certain tasks.
	- Help family if they really do need help and can't do things without you, but don't agree to everything they say without thinking it through first. 
		- Your goals are more important than being a doormat or problem solver for everyone.
- Cleaning, cooking, hygiene, etc.
	- Opportunities to practice discipline.
- Animal care
	- Looking after cats and chickens, they deserve care and compassion.
- Meetings and appointments
	- Add these to schedule when possible, plan ahead.

## Decision Filter:

Before doing any sort of request or distraction, ask the following questions:
1. Is this genuinely urgent? (Most things aren't)
2. Can someone else do this?
3. Does this align with my Tier 1-2 priorities?
4. What am I saying NO to if I say YES to this?

## Maximum and Minimum Timers:

I hyperfocus on things, so I need to have a max limit of when I stop on things, I need to respect my daily maximums and channel that energy towards tomorrow or other tasks.

Go 80% of what I can actually do.
