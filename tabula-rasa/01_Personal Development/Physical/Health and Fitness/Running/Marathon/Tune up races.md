## Recommended Tune-Up Race Schedule

### **10K Tune-Up Race**

**Target: Week 24-26 (February 2026)**
- Perfect timing after you've built your aerobic base
- Allows you to test your speed before marathon-specific training intensifies
- Good benchmark for fitness progression
- Won't interfere with the critical marathon pace work coming up

### **Half Marathon #1**

**Target: Week 30-32 (March 2026)**
- Ideal during your peak training phase
- Tests your ability to sustain faster paces over distance
- Great dress rehearsal for race day nutrition and pacing
- Should target around 1:35-1:40 based on your current fitness

### **Half Marathon #2 (Final Tune-Up)**

**Target: Week 35-36 (April 2026)**
- 3-4 weeks before Edinburgh Marathon
- Final race pace validation
- Should feel controlled and strong
- Target sub-1:35 if aiming for 3:30 marathon

## Strategic Considerations

**Distance from Marathon:**
- 10K: 16-18 weeks out (perfect for base fitness check)
- Half #1: 8-10 weeks out (peak training validation)
- Half #2: 3-4 weeks out (final tune-up, not too close to drain energy)

**Training Integration:**
- Replace your scheduled tempo/threshold workout that week
- Treat the race as a hard training session, not a standalone event
- Use these races to practice your pre-race routine and nutrition

**Pacing Strategy:**
- 10K: Run for time to gauge fitness
- Half #1: Practice negative splitting and race tactics
- Half #2: Execute marathon goal pace for first 10-15K, then gradually increase

This schedule gives you three data points to track your progress while perfectly timing the stress and recovery around your peak training phase.
