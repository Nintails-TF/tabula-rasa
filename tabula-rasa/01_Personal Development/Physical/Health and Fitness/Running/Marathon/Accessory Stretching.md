## WEEK 1 TIPS FOR SUCCESS

### Focus Points

- **Habit over perfection** - Show up even if you only do 3-4 exercises
- **Shorter holds are fine** - You're building the routine, not flexibility yet
- **Consistency over intensity** - Better to do it daily with shorter holds than skip days

### If You're Short on Time

**Morning (2-3 minutes minimum):**

- Hip circles (30 seconds)
- Arm circles (30 seconds)
- Cat-cow stretches (30 seconds)

**Evening (5-6 minutes minimum):**

- Hip flexor stretch (1 minute each side)
- Forward fold (1 minute)
- Doorway chest stretch (1 minute each arm)

### Common Week 1 Challenges

- **"I forgot"** → Set phone alarms for morning/evening
- **"I don't have time"** → Do the short version above
- **"It feels awkward"** → Normal! Your body is learning new patterns
- **"I don't feel more flexible"** → Flexibility comes in weeks 3-4, focus on the habit now

### Signs of Success

- ✓ Getting out of bed feels easier
- ✓ Less stiffness before workouts
- ✓ The routine starts feeling automatic
- ✓ You actually look forward to the evening stretches

## BREATHING REMINDER

**During all stretches:**

- Breathe normally through your nose
- Never hold your breath
- Use exhales to relax deeper into stretches
- If you can't breathe comfortably, back off the intensity

- Longer hold times (30-45 seconds)

**For now: Just show up every day. The magic is in the consistency.**
