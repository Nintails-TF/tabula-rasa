# 36-Week Edinburgh Marathon Plan (Terrain-Adapted)

**Goal:** Sub-3:35 (5:06/km on flat roads)  
**Current:** Week 6, recovering from shin splints  
**Terrain:** Cambered roads + forest trails (no flat options)  
**Training pace on terrain:** 7:00-8:45/km Zone 2

---

## KEY PRINCIPLES

- **4 runs per week maximum** (terrain = higher injury risk)
- **Walking 3-6 hours/week** (builds aerobic base, zero shin stress)
- **Strength 3-4x/week** (non-negotiable injury prevention)
- **Switch sides on cambered roads every 2-3 minutes**
- **Train by heart rate** (<138 BPM for easy runs)
- **Peak volume:** 50-55km running (lower due to terrain difficulty)

## PACE GUIDE

**Training paces on terrain (cambered roads/trails):**

- Easy runs: 7:30-8:30/km (Zone 2, <138 BPM)
- Recovery: 8:00-8:45/km
- Tempo: 5:50-6:15/km
- Marathon pace: 5:45/km (terrain-adjusted)

**Race day paces (flat Edinburgh roads):**

- Marathon pace: 5:06/km (sub-3:35 goal)
- Easy warm-up: 6:30/km

**Terrain effect:** Your 5:45/km on rough terrain = 5:06/km on flat roads!

---

## RACE GOALS

- **Primary:** Sub-3:35 (5:06/km)
- **Stretch:** Sub-3:30 (4:58/km)
- **Safety:** Sub-3:45 (5:19/km)

---

## WEEKLY RULES

1. ‚úÖ Maximum 4 runs/week
2. ‚úÖ Never skip strength work
3. ‚úÖ Switch sides on cambered roads every 2-3min
4. ‚úÖ Stop immediately if shin pain
5. ‚úÖ Train by HR (<138 BPM easy runs)
6. ‚úÖ Ice shins after harder runs
7. ‚úÖ One complete rest day/week

---

## SHIN SPLINT PREVENTION

**Daily (10min):**

- Calf/shin massage
- Toe walks + heel walks
- Ankle circles
- Check for tenderness

**After runs:**

- Ice 10min
- Calf stretch
- Shin stretch
- Elevate legs

**STOP running if:**

- Sharp pain during run
- Pain doesn't improve after warm-up
- Tenderness on shin bone
- Pain lasting >24 hours

---

## RACE DAY STRATEGY

**Pacing:**

- Km 0-10: 5:06/km (feels easy - trust it!)
- Km 10-30: 5:06/km (working but controlled)
- Km 30-42: 5:06/km (dig deep, count down)

**Nutrition:**

- Pre-race (3hrs): Breakfast (toast, banana, coffee)
- During: Gel every 30-45min starting at 60min
- Water at every aid station

**Mindset:**

- Flat Edinburgh roads will feel EASY after terrain training
- You're stronger than flat-trained runners
- Trust your 30 weeks of work

---

## THE BOTTOM LINE

**Your advantage:** Training on challenging terrain for 30 weeks makes you **strong**. Edinburgh's flat course will feel easier than training.

**Success = Showing up healthy + running smart + finishing strong**

**Sub-3:35 is excellent. Sub-3:30 is possible. Getting injured training is failure.**

**Now go heal those shins, start Week 6 recovery, and let's build to race day!** üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüí™
