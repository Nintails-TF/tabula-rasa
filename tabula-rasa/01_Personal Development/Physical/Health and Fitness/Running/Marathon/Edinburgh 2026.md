## Key Training Notes

### Pace Guidelines:

- **Easy pace:** Can hold conversation, 70-80% of weekly volume
- **Tempo pace:** Comfortably hard, ~15-20 seconds slower than 10k pace
- **Marathon pace:** Target race pace (11:27/mile for 5:00 goal)
- **5k pace:** Hard but controlled, use for interval training

### Weekly Structure Rules:

1. **One hard day, one easy day** - never two hard days back-to-back
2. **Long run always followed by easy day or rest**
3. **Listen to your body** - adjust if feeling overly fatigued
4. **Consistency over perfection** - hitting 90% of planned mileage is better than 100% one week and 60% the next

### Progression Philosophy:

- **Increase weekly mileage by no more than 10% per week**
- **Every 4th week is a cutback week** (reduce by 15-20%)
- **Build slowly and steadily** - this is a marathon, not a sprint!

### Mr Boring Success Formula:

✅ Show up every day  
✅ Run easy when it says easy  
✅ Hit your weekly mileage targets  
✅ Get adequate sleep and nutrition  
✅ Stay injury-free through consistency
