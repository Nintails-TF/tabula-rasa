# Anti-Shin Splints Recovery & Prevention Plan

## Phase 1: Recovery (Days 1-5)

**Goal**: Let inflammation settle and begin gentle strengthening

### Daily Actions

- **Complete rest** from running (no exceptions!)
- **Ice therapy**: 15-20 minutes on tender spots, 2-3 times daily
- **Gentle stretching**: Light calf stretches, hold 30 seconds each
- **Anti-inflammatory support**: Ibuprofen as needed, anti-inflammatory foods

### Begin Strengthening (Day 3 onwards)

**Toe Walks**: 3 sets of 30 seconds, walk on toes **Heel Walks**: 3 sets of 30 seconds, walk on heels with toes up **Alphabet Draws**: Each foot "writes" alphabet in air while seated **Calf Raises**: 2 sets of 15, both legs together

## Phase 2: Gentle Return (Days 6-12)

**Goal**: Test readiness and build base strength

### Running Protocol

- **Day 6**: 15-minute easy walk, assess how shins feel
- **Day 8**: 10-minute run/walk intervals (1 min run, 1 min walk)
- **Day 10**: 15-minute easy run IF no shin pain during Day 8
- **Day 12**: 20-minute easy run IF previous went well

### Daily Strengthening (Continue from Phase 1, but add)

**Single-leg calf raises**: 2 sets of 10 each leg **Resistance band dorsiflexion**: Pull toes toward shin, 2 sets of 15 **Balance exercises**: Stand on one foot, 30 seconds each

### Rules

- Stop immediately if tender spots return during running
- Ice after each run
- Never run on consecutive days during this phase

## Phase 3: Progressive Building (Days 13-28)

**Goal**: Gradually increase running load while maintaining shin health

### Running Schedule

**Week 1**: Every other day, 20-25 minutes easy **Week 2**: Every other day, 25-30 minutes easy **Week 3**: Add one back-to-back day (but easy pace) **Week 4**: Normal schedule if no issues

### Advanced Strengthening

**Lateral toe taps**: Tap toes side to side, 30 seconds **Single-leg balance on unstable surface**: 30 seconds each **Plyometric calf raises**: Quick up-down motion, 2 sets of 10 **Tibialis anterior strengthening**: Flex foot against resistance

### Surface Strategy

- Prioritize softer surfaces (grass, dirt, rubber track)
- Gradually reintroduce harder surfaces after Week 2
- Vary surfaces within runs when possible

## Ongoing Prevention (Month 2+)

### Weekly Routine

- **Strength work**: 3x per week (pick 3-4 exercises from above)
- **Surface variety**: Mix hard and soft surfaces
- **Monitor symptoms**: Weekly self-check of tender spots
- **Recovery focus**: One easy/rest day after harder sessions

### Warning Signs to Watch

- Return of tender spots when pressed
- Any pain during running
- Tightness that doesn't improve with stretching
- Swelling around shins

### Form Reminders

- Maintain your 170-180 cadence (it's ideal!)
- Land with feet under your center of mass
- Stay relaxed through shoulders and arms
- Listen to your body's daily feedback

## Emergency Protocol

If tender spots return at ANY phase:

1. Take 2-3 days complete rest immediately
2. Return to ice therapy
3. Drop back one phase in the plan
4. Consider gait analysis or shoe evaluation

## Success Metrics

- **Week 1**: No tender spots when pressed
- **Week 2**: Comfortable 20-minute runs
- **Week 4**: Back to desired training frequency
- **Month 2**: Confident in shin durability

Remember: This plan prioritizes long-term running health over short-term fitness gains. Better to build slowly and run for years than rush and get sidelined repeatedly.
