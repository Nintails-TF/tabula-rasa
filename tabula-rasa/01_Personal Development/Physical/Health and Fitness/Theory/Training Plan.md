# Training Plan

## Sustainable Year Plan

### Phase 1: Foundation (Months 1-4)
- **Lifting:** 3-4x/week, maintain your current routine
- **Running:** Build to 50-60km/week
## Months 1-4 Weekly Schedule

### **The Core Structure (6 Days/Week)**

**Monday:** Upper Body Lifting (90 min)
- Your current routine with Cameron or solo
- Post-workout: 20-30 min easy walk

**Tuesday:** Easy Run (45-60 min)
- 6-8km at conversational pace (Zone 1-2)
- Should feel refreshed, not tired

**Wednesday:** Lower Body Lifting (90 min)
- Your current leg routine
- Focus on functional strength (squats, RDLs, lunges)

**Thursday:** Medium Run (45-60 min)
- 7-10km at comfortable pace (Zone 2)
- Slightly more effort than Tuesday, but still conversational

**Friday:** Upper Body Lifting (90 min)
- Second upper session of the week

**Saturday:** Long Run (60-120 min)
- Start at 12-15km, build to 25-30km by month 4
- **Key rule:** Slow enough to maintain conversation
- This is your marathon fitness builder

**Sunday:** Complete Rest or Active Recovery
- Light walk, stretching, meal prep
- Essential for adaptation

## Progressive Weekly Mileage:

| Week  | Tuesday | Thursday | Saturday | Total Weekly |
| ----- | ------- | -------- | -------- | ------------ |
| 1-2   | 6km     | 7km      | 12km     | 25km         |
| 3-4   | 7km     | 8km      | 15km     | 30km         |
| 5-6   | 7km     | 9km      | 18km     | 34km         |
| 7-8   | 8km     | 10km     | 20km     | 38km         |
| 9-12  | 8km     | 10km     | 22-25km  | 40-43km      |
| 13-16 | 8km     | 11km     | 25-30km  | 44-49km      |

### Phase 2: Strength Focus (Months 5-8)
- **Lifting:** 4x/week, push for strength gains
- **Running:** Maintain 40-50km/week (fitness preservation)
- **Target:** Build the physique you want

### Phase 3: Running Focus (Months 9-12)
- **Lifting:** 2-3x/week (maintenance)
- **Running:** Peak at 70-80km/week
- **Target:** Improve marathon time significantly

## Key Principles for Success

**1. Nutrition is Everything**
- Higher calories than typical marathon runners (you're supporting muscle)
- Adequate protein (1.6-2g/kg) to maintain muscle
- Carb cycling: more on high-volume running days

**2. Smart Training Distribution**
- **80% easy running** (you can hold a conversation)
- **Strength focus on compound movements** (maintain muscle efficiently)
- **One long run weekly** building to 32km

**3. Body Composition Targets**
- **165-175lbs** (slightly higher than your original "steel feather")
- **12-15% body fat** (sustainable while marathon training)
- **Focus on muscle quality over size**

## Realistic Marathon Progression
- **First marathon:** 4:30-5:00 (completion focused)
- **Year 2:** 4:00-4:15 (with consistent training)
- **Year 3+:** 3:45-4:00 (if you stay consistent)

This keeps you well away from the "twig" marathon runner look while still achieving genuine marathon fitness. You'll look like someone who clearly lifts AND can run 26.2 miles - which is honestly more impressive than being elite at either alone.

**The key insight:** Recreational marathon performance + aesthetic physique is the sweet spot you're looking for.
