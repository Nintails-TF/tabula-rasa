# Calisthenics

**4-Day Training Split:**
- Monday: Upper Push (weighted push-ups, overhead press, dips, pike push-ups)
- Wednesday: Lower Body (Bulgarian split squats, Romanian deadlifts, Nordic curls, hip thrusts)
- Friday: Upper Pull (weighted pull-ups/chin-ups, dumbbell rows, face pulls)
- Saturday: Conditioning/Skills (flexible - circuits, skills work, or rest)

**Core Principles:**
- Focus on progressive overload (adding weight, reps, or sets each week)
- Track every workout meticulously
- 60-minute sessions with adequate rest between sets
- Emphasis on compound movements (pull-ups as the "secret weapon")

**Recovery & Nutrition:**
- 8+ hours sleep mandatory
- 2,700-2,800 calories daily with 180-190g protein
- Vitamin D3 supplementation (4000 IU)
- Morning walks for sunlight exposure
- Deload every 8 weeks
