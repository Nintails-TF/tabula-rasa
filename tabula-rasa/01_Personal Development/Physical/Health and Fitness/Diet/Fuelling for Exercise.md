# Fuelling for Exercise:

## **Daily Carb Periodization**

**High Days (Saturday long runs): 450-500g carbs**
- Pre-run: 50-75g (2-3 hours before)
- During run: 30-60g/hour (runs >90 min)
- Post-run: 100-150g within 2 hours

**Medium Days (Tue/Thu runs): 350-400g carbs**
- Standard target, emphasize post-workout timing

**Lower Days (Sunday rest): 250-300g carbs**
- Still higher than your cutting phase to support recovery

## **Practical Application**

### **Pre-Training Fueling**
- **Lifting days:** 30-50g carbs 1-2 hours before
- **Running days:** 50-75g carbs 2-3 hours before
- **Long runs:** Test different foods during training

### **Post-Training Recovery**
- **Immediately after:** 30-50g carbs + 20-30g protein
- **Within 2 hours:** Full meal with 100-150g carbs

## **Hydration Scaling**
- **Base:** 3L/day (your current target)
- **Training days:** +500-750ml
- **Long run days:** +1-1.5L
- **Monitor urine colour** - should be pale yellow
