# Introduction:

When we do exercise, our body needs energy to perform both aerobic and anaerobic exercise. Our cells need **ATP** (Adenosine triphosphate), which requires glucose. All of the macronutrients that we eat are converted into glucose.

The body has stores of glucose in the body where we either replenish our stores or use our stores, depending on our hormonal state. These are our **glycogen stores**.

For exercise, performance, and even just daily tasks. Understanding how we can fuel ourselves is key, so that we are ready for the trials and tribulations ahead.
