# August Goal

## **August 2025 Fitness Goal: Half-Marathon Completion + Transition**

### **Primary Goal: Complete Your First Half-Marathon**

- **Target:** Sub-2:30:00 (conservative first-timer goal)
- **Focus:** Completion over speed
- **Date:** Plan for mid-to-late August to allow proper taper

### **Weekly Structure (First 3 Weeks of August):**

**Monday:** Upper Body Lifting (maintain strength) **Tuesday:** Easy Run 8-10km (Zone 1-2) **Wednesday:** Lower Body Lifting (functional focus) **Thursday:** Tempo Run 10-12km (Zone 2-3) **Friday:** Upper Body Lifting **Saturday:** Long Run 16-20km (peak distance) **Sunday:** Rest or easy walk

**Weekly Volume:** Peak at 50-55km in early August

### **Taper Strategy (Week of Race):**

- Reduce volume by 40-50%
- Maintain intensity but cut duration
- Focus on mobility and recovery
- Keep lifting light and movement-focused

### **Post-Race Transition Goals:**

- **Week 1 after race:** Complete rest and recovery
- **Week 2-3:** Easy running + return to full lifting schedule
- **Week 4:** Begin strength-focused phase

### **August Metrics to Track:**

- ✅ Complete 21.1km without walking
- ✅ Maintain current lifting strength throughout training
- ✅ Hit weekly volume targets (45-55km)
- ✅ Perfect your race-day nutrition strategy
- ✅ Body weight stable around 72-75kg

This sets you up perfectly for your transition back to more lifting focus in September while achieving your running milestone. The half-marathon will be a huge confidence boost and proof of your endurance base!
