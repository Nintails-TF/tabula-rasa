## Key Principles & Reminders

### On Discipline

- Systems over motivation
- Daily habits over occasional heroics
- Marathon training teaches: Consistency compounds
- The middle years (3-5) are where most quit - push through

### On Rest

- Real rest restores, fake rest depletes
- Real: Sleep, nature, friends, casual play
- Fake: Social media, binge-watching, scrolling
- Sleep is non-negotiable: 8 hours minimum

### On Social Life

- Loneliness at the top is normal
- Find 2-3 people who understand and support you
- Everyone else will think you're weird - that's fine
- Your path is yours, not theirs

### On Setbacks

- Injury, job loss, market crashes, plateaus WILL happen
- "The obstacle is the way"
- Adjust, don't quit
- Every setback is data for better strategy

### On Money

- Money is the scoreboard, not the point
- The point is capability, freedom, and becoming excellent
- Don't sacrifice health or relationships for money
- But also: Don't waste your potential on comfort

### On Integration

- Running + Russian podcasts = 8-12 hrs/week overlap
- Chess + Russian content = 3-5 hrs/week overlap
- These aren't separate goals - they're one system
- Find synergies, don't just add things

### On Joy

- Keep some activities pure (chess for fun, runs for joy)
- Don't optimize everything into instrumentality
- The intrinsic motivation is what sustains you
- If you stop enjoying these things, reassess

### If Market Crash

4. You want to take your dad to Russia - a shared dream
5. You love solving hard problems and building skills

## Final Reminders

> "The first 100k is a bitch to get. After that you can ease off the gas." - Charlie Munger

You're going for 10x that. It won't be easy. But you already have what most people don't:

- Discipline (proven through marathons)
- Strategic thinking (chess)
- Long-term vision (this plan)
- Systematic approach (integrated learning)
- Genuine interest (not just chasing money)

**You've got this.**

Вперёд к величию. (Forward to greatness.)
