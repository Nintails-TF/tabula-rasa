## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### "I'm Not Tired at 9pm"

- Start anyway - the routine creates sleepiness
- Dim lights throughout the house from 8:30pm
- No caffeine after 2pm, limit screen time after 8pm

### "Work Thoughts Keep racing"

- Extend brain dump time - write everything down
- Use "worry window" - designate tomorrow 6pm to address concerns
- Practice thought-stopping: "I've written it down, I can let it go"

### "I Keep 'just Checking' My phone"

- Phone stays in different room from 10pm onwards
- Use analog alarm clock instead of phone
- Replace phone checking with physical book

_"If it's bedtime, I'm going to bed. Unless something earthshattering is going on, it can wait until tomorrow." - Your boundary from the documents_
