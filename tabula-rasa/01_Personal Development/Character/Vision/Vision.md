# Living a Better Life:

## Vision:

I want to live a life where I'm proud of who I am. To aspire to be great and to develop a broad depth of skills, experiences and wisdom.

I want to be rock solid, dependable, calm and cool. So that I have independence and others can trust me.

I need to max out money, physicality, connections, career, got the best chances of doing this when I'm young, so I'm on a timer.

Physical Factors:
- [[Metabolic Requirements]]
Neurochemical Factors
- [[Neurochemical Requirements]]
Psychological Factors
- [[Features of Character]]
Social Factors
- [[Interpersonal Dynamics]]
Environmental Factors
- [[Environmental Ideals]]

# Hierarchy of Vision:

1. Physical Factors and Neurochemical Factors
	1. They are the foundation of everything so they are the most mission critical.
2. Environmental factors
	1. Since I generally have control over my own environments that is something that I'm able to optimise to improve all other aspects of my life.
3. Psychological and Social Factors
	1. After I've worked on myself, now I have the space to work on higher value concepts within myself and others.
