# Developing Your Ideal Routine:

When building up a routine. We want to make it consistent and habitual, so that you can put in the reps in a healthy manner.

To achieve this, we can implement a few key principles:
1. Make it obvious. (Cue)
2. Make it easy. (Craving)
3. Make it attractive. (Response)
4. Make it satisfying. (Reward)

I could write about these things for hours, but for the sake of brevity, here is the main tree of decisions that is good to follow:

1. What is your current routine?
	1. Note down how long you are practicing for and what you are doing.
		1. Do this for at least a week, if that is too long, at least do it for 3 days.
	2. Mark and evaluate the list of actions with a -, = or +. i.e. actions you want to stop doing, actions that are negligible and actions that are positive towards your goal.
		1. Honesty and an objective mindset is key here, don't bullshit yourself.
	3. Focus on developing a positive, or minimizing a problem in your current training practice.
2. Write up an initial draft of your routine, being as honest and realistic as possible, with the goals that you have and the resources that you can spend currently.
	1. For instance, you will have less time during exam season, so make your training shorter and you will have more time during a summer holiday.
	2. Make the routine short and easy to complete, don't run before you can walk. Just by having some kind of regimented practice, you're doing better than 90% of players.
		1. We will build up duration and intensity gradually over time.
	3. Do this step for at least a week, minimum 3 days.
3. Evaluate your routine. What was successful and unsuccessful?
	1. After completing your training for the day, note down any positives or negatives that you experience. Evaluate these and make adjustments when needed.
