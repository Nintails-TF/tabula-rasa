# Interpersonal Dynamics:

How do I want to conduct myself in a social setting and around other people?

# Protocols:
- *Remind yourself of your core values each day when you wake up.*
- *Identify challenging interactions and plan ahead.*
	- *Don't ruminate about things, but have a general idea.*
- *Keep eye contact and an open posture during conversation.*
- *Avoid interrupting others if not critical, let others finish themselves.*
- *Offer practical help and not just blind sympathy.* 
- *Remember key details about people to better understand them and the approach needed.*
- *Have a "I need some time to think about this" if you are struggling in a conversation.*
- *Identify things you won't stand for and communicate them clearly and calmly.*

# Points:
- I want to be rational, serious, kind and disciplined.
- I want to show my love and compassion in more subtle ways. A sort of tough love.
- Authenticity - finding the balance between how you want to act and how you naturally act.
- Adaptability - Certain contexts require different tones and approaches.
- Self-compassion, being kind to yourself even if you don't meet standards.
- Boundaries - Don't neglect your own needs and speak up when you need something
- Body Language - Show using your body that you care about people, using presence and actions.
- Intentional speech - Be deliberate when you speak.
