# Character of myself:

## Protocols:
- *Before responding, take a few seconds pause to process what was being said.*
- *If feeling rushed say "Let me think about that for a moment."*
- *Keep instances of situations you think are going to go bad and write the actual vs feared outcome.*
- *Summarise what people are saying into points, have time after big conversations to reflect about things.*
- *Get in the head of others and try think about how they are seeing things.*

## Points

Who would I want to be that would make me feel good about myself?

- I enjoy listening to others and myself. With me reflecting on things, I wish that in social situations, I could think about what somebody is saying and then think about it then give them my view or insight. I feel forced a lot of the time to come up with something quick.
- I value those who are supportive and caring. But who don't take shit.
- I value my independence, I don't like relying on other people too much, especially for things that are important to me, unless I trust them deeply.
- Sometimes, I'm scared to speak up or voice my opinion, I don't know how to shake this since I'm worried about getting backlash sometimes - it does help in occasions but hurts at other times.
- I dislike people who talk lots but say little, I deeply respect those who talk little but say lots.
	- The first kind of person is good for smalltalk and building quick connections with others, but you are going to struggle to get deep communication with them, it isn't impossible just a challenge.
	- Really don't enjoy when people talk with lots of "uhs", "likes" or "ums"
- I want to be able to speak a bit louder and a bit deeper and slower.
	- More deliberate speech so people can clearly hear me and understand me.
- I enjoy when I make others think about themselves and grow as a person when I speak, they see a different point of view or perspective on the matter.
- At my best, I'd like to be laser focussed and disciplined, to do what I want to do and what I need to do clearly and efficiently.
