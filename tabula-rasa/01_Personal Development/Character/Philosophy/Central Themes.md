# Central Themes of My Philosophy:

Authenticity VS Social Masks
Suffering as Meaningful
Balance between comfort and discipline
Critiques of modernity and systems
Personal agency within constraints
Mind body connection
Finding meaning in a seemingly indifferent world

I don't care what the activity is. If I'm with a band of my boys working towards any sort of goal or achievement, that makes me feel really happy. If it's hiking, video games, or military service.
