# Mindset Cultivation

What I'm looking for is a mix of stoicism, emotional detachment, and Machiavellianism.

- Stoicism
	- Would be control over my own emotions and reactions.
- Mental Detachment
	- Would be control over my investment in others, investing in those who matter and not in those who do not matter.
- Machiavellianism
	- Would be engaging with people based on their utility to my goals and ideals.

## In Practice:

### Stoicism:
- Daily Reflection - How could I of acted and responded more rationally.
- Negative Visualisation - What is the worst that can happen, if it does happen, remain calm.
- Control and Acceptance - Focus on only what I can actually control, rather than outside circumstances.
- Delayed Reaction - When emotion is evoked, give a brief pause before reacting, for instance 10 seconds, think *does this really matter?*

### Mental Detachment:
- Randoms are background noise - Most people you meet aren't important do your life goals, so don't overinvest in them.
- Observe, Don't Absorb - Listen to others, but don't take on their problems, offer solutions if it helps you, otherwise you can disengage.
- Personal Disclosure - The less people know about you, the less they can manipulate or influence you, keeping interactions surface level can help avoid this, unless deeper details are required.
- Indifference - If somebody praises/criticises you, remain neutral. External validation shouldn't dictate your actions.

### Machiavellianism:
- Read People - Pay attention to what motivates people, what they fear and what they want.
- Give and Take - Only give if it strengthens alliances or builds leverage for future favours. Avoid giving away resources freely, unless strategic in nature.
- Silence - Speak less and listen more, people often reveal useful information if you let them, silence also gives you more authority.
- Deception - Don't lie, but know when to withhold information, misdirect or to play dumb can be helpful.
- Good Allies - Choose relationships that provide value and distance yourself from liabilities.

### Mental Toughness:
- Do the uncomfortable daily - Limit your comfort, so that when negativity appears, your body and mind are ready.
- Say "No" without guilt - Everyone has boundaries, and you can deny those who impede on your time and resources, if they aren't giving anything back.
- Handle confrontation rationally - Act in a cool and calm way when dealing with conflict, emotions can be used, but letting them burst forth can lead to an unpredictable and uncontrolled explosion.
- Test Influence subtly - Test with people what they are willing to do for you, if someone is willing to do lots for you note that, if someone isn't willing to do anything for you, note that too. Adjust your responses to them.
