> "*I was signed up to ride in the prologue of the Tour back in 1995, but it was made very obvious to me I would have to take drugs. I said no, no way, and I was sacked by my team. So there I was, 11 years later, sitting there waiting for the Tour cyclists to come by, and something welled up in me. I feel I was robbed by a lot of these bastards taking drugs. I also hate the way that people think anyone who has ever achieved anything on a bike must have been taking drugs.*" - **Graeme Obree**

*Find the essentials that need to be done and complete them before moving to greater things. With this approach you build a healthy foundation in which you life lies upon. Without it you are building a house on a bed of sand.* (Biblical Roots, James Clear)

*There always is that voice inside my head, that tells me to give up, to succumb to my basic desires and eventually to cease living. I can't bury it within me anymore, it comes bursting out. If you try a bottle any river, said bottle will crack - all you can do is let that emotion flow and come to terms with it as a part of your nature and environment.* (Jungian, Nietzsche)

*Nobody actually cares about your suffering, aside from maybe the 10-20 people in your life that truly will, guard those people with your life. Not to say that common people are evil, but they are just indifferent.* (Bukowski, Epictetus)

*What you place in your stomach, you place into your mind.* (Aryuveda, Hippocrates)

*I wish I knew why we bury ourself with the mask of kindness and generosity, when we are suffering the most.* (Nietzsche, Gabor Mate, Brene Brown)

*Books and reading the texts of men lost to time, has been my rare connection to others, I feel as if somebody throughout the chapter of life has written what I've been thinking.* (Hermann Hesse, C.S. Lewis)

*I always hunger for more, but it is never enough. A dog howling at the moon, we don't choose what is good for us, we choose the ideas that best serve us. That they march into the mind, twisting and turning to gorge of the blood of the soul.* (Schopenhauer, Cioran)

*To expand upon comfort and discipline. I would suggest that discipline is akin to water, the body without water will quickly fall apart, as do people without order, discipline, and consistency. Comfort is similar to food. Indulge in the comforts of fast food and sugar and you'll pay the price later down the line, eat too much and your soul will swell with obesity. But absolve it completely and you'll be skeletal, a brittle man pushed to a breaking point.* (Aristotle, Foucault, Csikszentmihalyi)

*The fact of the matter is, that every word you've heard from this voice of mine, is not me. It is a mask, a persona, of who I wish to project to you. I feel the need to be positive to you, not because I respect or enjoy your company but out of a deep fear of conflict, rejection, and pain. So I still keep smiling and laughing at every little thing when I'm with you.* (Sartre - Bad Faith, Nietzsche, Brene Brown)

*The creaking and cackling of the noose is only silenced by by purpose.* (Frankl - "Those who have a why, can bear any how.")

*A man is chained to a bar, forced to pick his poison, and suffer with a laugh and a grin. Once more and more bottles are down he admires how good his life was and how good he is feeling. But then after enough drink, the pleasure is suffocating, as the alcohol persuades him into an slumber. He begs for a change that never comes.* (Buddhism, Addiction)

*Modernity is hell. Since not only the people, yet the systems have been brainwashed into and atomised into numbers, failures and winners, and the mode of survival is the default, we no longer brought up to thrive, but born into a world in which is toxic, and fed the falsehoods of so call progress. Still I wonder, when is all of this going to come crashing down?* (Herbert Marcuse, Charles Taylor)

*Still, where there is poison in the body. The antibodies fight back. Fevers, malaise, sickness flood the system. Then there is that moment of clarity in the storm, where we can see a path forward.

That we can become human again.* (Camus, Ivan Illich, Vaclav Havel)

*Collectively, we see the rain or snow and frown. Yet what if a man was to see the rain and smile? To accept that nature is outside of his grasp, and to still go outside. The youthful man can dash out and brave the elements, whilst the old man equips and prepares himself to enjoy the elements with a grin of peace. When I see rain, I see opportunity to be the person who I want to be.* (Stoic, Thoreau, Nietzsche, Thich Nhat Hanh)

*Sometimes, when my skin burns from histamine and my cells scream out in pain, I have to remind myself to breathe, to understand that what I am feeling and being compelled to do. Isn't going to save me. Yet it is the careful routine emblements, ointments and routine which create peace. Your emotions are produced from past, present, and future action. It pays great interest to take a step back in a time of strife.* (Martha Nussbaum, Jon Kabat-Zinn, Michel Foucault)

*You have to understand, that when I am afraid to talk about my thoughts to you it means that I care about you. When I'm willing to speak my mind, it is to those who don't matter to me.* (Sartre, Brene Brown)

*Opponents should be used to bring out the best in yourself, to push yourself to the maximum and to raise the stakes. We are at our peak when we are chasing or being chased, that feeling is tantalising and addictive, it feels much better transient pleasures of comfort or sex.* (Machiavelli, Nietzsche, Marcus Aurelius)

*There is too much opportunity in freedom to waste your life on trivialities. A disciplined life constructed from your own desire is the key to be truly free.* (Camus, Kant)

*Everything happens for a reason, why we suffer, why we feel joy, why even in the darkest pit of a depression. That something is being expressed, that something might change. That it only has to be found and realised, to be the rope out of said pit.* (Jung, Frankl, determinism and agency)

*I don't even think about others, beyond what I can see in the moment, when they are out of view. My brain simply erases their existence from my mind. Not that I wish harm or malice towards others, I do wish for the best. But I don't feel a deep connection to others, beyond a few fleeting moments.* (Fundamental Isolation, Cognitive empathy)

*It feels so strange, when I'm far away from others I don't feel them and when I'm close I feel everything. When others have emotional outbursts, I do too. Am I just a parrot trying to squawk and fit in with the flock, or is it real consideration for others?* (Autism)

*I feel as if I'm a sheep in a world of wolves, that I have to put on the costume of a wolf and dine on bloody carcasses, until the costume doesn't come off anymore, and I am lost.* (Sartre bad faith)

*If I'm an outcast - either I can band together with those who have been discarded and become the king of the scrapheap, or I can sneak my way back into the city and burn the pain away, with thousands of matches screaming. But even though parts of me wish for these outcomes, what I wish for is a hierarchy where I can throw myself into as a nobody and make my way to the top, it is those games which stirs my blood. To live as an athlete or as a soldier is appealing - to seek the highest level of quality and performance for my people and myself.* (Dostoevsky, Nietzsche)

*I want to life that simple life, running for miles per day - following orders to fulfil a mission of a commander or coach.* (Epictetus, Frankl)

*Though I'm afraid. I've heard horror stories of abuse, neglect, and pain. The people at the top have no care about those at the bottom. I guess what that means is that I need to rise through and above it.* (Foucault, Orwell)

*I don't know what to do, everything I do feels painful. There isn't any joy in any of it. I don't like working, I don't like having free time. I enjoy exercise, but that is about it, but that doesn't pay the bills unless you are a superstar, and I don't have the confidence to be that. Nobody will care about me since I'm past my prime anyways. What is some random 22 year old going to be the next stand out athlete, invest in some teenagers and build them up instead. I want people to shout my name, to let me know that I matter and that I exist, to cheer me on.* (Camus, Kierkegaard)

*Where ambition meets industry, passion is poisoned by greed.* (Marx, Wilde)

*Mastery of playing behind the scenes is required when in a group or organisation. You must position yourself such as a king, or you will be sacrificed like a pawn when you time comes and you cease being useful to leaders.* (Machiavelli, Greene)

*These people who walk around me aren't true people. They are following a script given to them by a manager, a parent, or by the tongue of society. A philosophical mind on the street, is similar to a man moonwalking down one!* (Nietzsche, Camus)

*In the eyes of others I'm nothing more than a tool, the question is to live within their expectations or to break them? To provide the common answer and receive the common payment, or to roll the dice of novelty to seek for connection. Perhaps, it is person dependant: To those who are far - give them what they expect and to those who are close, open yourself up.* (Goffman, Nietzsche)

*It is hard for me to admit, but am I'm sickened by the masses of people. Blubbering whales rolling around on scooters, students running off with daddies money who blindly spit out propaganda for a cause they've been taught to believe, the feeble elderly shuffling around the street looking lost and forgotten in the world, those intoxicated with all manners of alcohol, nicotine, turning a brain into plasticine. What happened to regular people? Where have they gone?* (Hesse, T.S. Eliot)

*Connection is impossible, when the ears that could of heard you have gone deaf many years ago. Now the sight of a dollar is the only reason for strangers to listen.* (Dostoevsky, Guy Debord)

*In this world, it is either exploit or be exploited. We no longer fight physically but we fight through systems of bureaucracy, hierarchies, and rules. To be caught means to fall down a snake, to slip by means catching a ladder. The regular path of going step by step is incompatible with the skyscrapers that we must scale today, which were the second floor of yesterday. But at the end of the day, it's all a game, if we are winners or we are losers in this grand scheme, those who can lose with a smile are better off than those who tear up relationships and frown with a win. But worst of all are losers who cry about it, they are no better than children.*

*The tool to reach the top is ruthless manipulation, to stab and maim with a smile and plausible deniability. We denigrate what is immoral, because we are weak and are unable to use these techniques to secure our own advantage which of course we would if it was possible for us get away with. But go ahead and call those who rule you corrupt, see if they care about the life of livestock.* (Machiavellian)

*If a person is scared about not being good enough for a leader, they must lead as they care about people. If a person has a obsession with leading, they must not be enabled to lead, as they only care about themselves.*

*A leader shouldn't shackle people and control them, but guide them into a place where they can be at peak performance.*

*Figure out the skills that a person has, place them accordingly, enhance their strengths and weaknesses, give them independence, then let them run the show.*

*When you look up into the sky at night, you see stars that shine brightly, in which everyone admires their beauty. But these stars cannot exist with out the black void of space between them. I'm the void that isn't seen, heard, or admired. But the stars they understand me.*

*AI is talking to myself at light-speed.*

The question is what happens to people who:
- Can't access/use AI tools (digital divide)
- Don't have strong human connections (isolated)
- Get stuck trying to use AI for emotional needs or humans for cognitive leverage inefficiently
