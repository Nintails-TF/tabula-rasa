# My Approach to Learning:

needs to be more lean and concise, to focus on the bigger picture.

1. Taking in new information/knowledge.
	1. Scan the text or resource.
	2. Writing down of concepts and notes.
		1. Performing active recall after reading or listening to any pieces of media and try to explain the main ideas without any references.
2. Self-explaining and thinking about the information.
	1. Processing notes, rewriting notes and condensing information
	2. Performing active recall.
3. Performing practice problems that use interleaving mixing previously known concepts with new ones.
	1. Analysing any mistakes.
4. Write summaries and guides.
5. Write findings in a learning journal.
6. Create spaced repetition exercises to increase retention of critical information. With increasing intervals of time.

# Brainstorming:

Scan the material to build a mental framework.

With note taking, have brief moments of active recall, where you pause for a second and try to explain what you've seen without any references.

After each major idea, write a quick summary without looking at the source material.

Interleaving of information - e.g. scattering different questions based around the same topic can enhance neural links and pathways between a field of expertise.

Start with basic questions and problems, then move to more complex applications.

Perform spaced repetition using increasing intervals of time.

## How to Scan Material:

Look at any headings, sub-headings, bold-text, summaries or conclusions. Looking at the first and last sentences of each paragraph.

## When You Can't Remember without References:

This is a step in active recall called **desirable difficulty.** In which your brain is being primed to learn that information again when you review it again.

- Give yourself 30 seconds or so to recall without looking back.
- When you look back, pay attention to any gaps between what you could and couldn't recall.
	- This enables you to figure out what you need to focus on more.

## A Quick Summary:

A quick summary takes around 2-3 sentences and takes no longer than 60 seconds to write. Focus on the core idea and 1-2 supporting details.
