# Learning Journal

## What I Learned Today - 29/12/24:
- How to make cards within Anki
- What the book Linux Basic for Hackers is about.
	- Primarily about using Linux with some pieces of networking, scripting and external tools.
- Hacking is an art - which provides an individual freedom of expression through the medium of technology.

## Key Insights:
- Going through my learning process is difficult and challenges my brain.
- Making a cheat-sheet of commands is going to be useful.
- I like including my own pieces of insight and thought processes in notes.

## Questions or Confusions:
- What concepts should I place within Anki and what concepts should I avoid?
	- What criteria should I used when deciding which concepts are Anki-worthy?
- What should I focus on learning and what shouldn't I be learning?
- How could I use interleaving techniques within a structured book like that?
- Are there any complimentary resources I could use to spice up learning?

## Applications and Next Steps:
- Find some kind of way of generating practical ideas that reinforce what I'm learning.
	- Brainstorming sessions, researching small projects.
- My ability to apply my learning methodology has gotten a better, since I've started to take a more active and structured approach.
- Are there any practical exercises I could do to enhance my understanding or knowledge?

## What I Learned Today - 30/12/24
- Re-affirming core Linux terminal commands for moving around, managing files, finding files, filtering for meaningful data and how to search for help in the terminal.
	- `cd, ls, pwd, ps, mkdir, cd, touch, cat, whereis, locate, find, mv, rm`
- Learning about the intricacies of wildcards and how you can search for wildcards with the `*` mainly, but also `[ ] and ?`.

## Key Insights:
- Learning raw commands and what they do is pretty dry.
- Doing exercise before sitting down and learning helps me focus.
- It's easy to avoid the step of performing active recall and just passively read and note information down.

## Questions or Confusions:
- I'm not sure how I should be structuring blocks of code, should I include screen shot examples, or is a command + comment enough?
	- Only Screenshot if you need to, comments usually suffice, unless there is an interaction of note.
	
```Bash
# Purpose: Find all PDF files modified in last 24 hours
find /home -name "*.pdf" -mtime -1
# Output: Lists relevant files with paths
```

- Is there any way to make learning about commands more streamlined or interesting?
	- Swapping between reading commands, then going into the terminal and actually using them would make learning more interactive.

## Applications and Next Steps:
- Starting the new practice questions that I've made tomorrow.
- Making some more anki cards about meaningful concepts from chapter 1.
	- Creating anki cards about wildcards would be a good method of remembering what the different kinds of wildcards actually do.
	- This could also be supplemented with the purpose of non-obvious commands. e.g. what exactly does whereis do?
		- Use common flags as well.
- Re-drafting notes and making them more concise and clear.

## What I Learned Today - 31/12/24:
## Key Insights:
- Doing practical exercises is more engaging but is also pretty draining.
- My skill level isn't high enough to do the final mastery challenge yet.
- I still sometimes slip into a passive style of learning, where I don't do any active recall during the note taking process.
- I learned a lot more about how to use `find`, `grep` and `locate` to filter for text or knowledge that I want quickly.
- Through the practical activity involving file permissions, I learned about
	- Changing the file permissions of a document using the numeric chmod codes.
	- adding new users and groups; checking that they've been added.
	- Assigning a group to a file using the `chgrp` command.
	- Switching users with the `su` command.
	- Deleting users and groups properly.
- Through the log collection activity I learned about
	- Filtering with `find` using the `-size` flag.
	- Piping commands to `xargs` to copy the output of `find` to a directory.
	- Using `strings` in combination with `sed`to filter `.journal` files that are treated as binaries into human-readable text.
## Questions or Confusions:
- Is it a bad idea to use AI tools to come up with commands that help me? Wouldn't it impede my learning?
	- But wouldn't it also take much longer for me to be able to do things without them?
- Progress is a lot slower then I'd like - is that because I'm using a rather comprehensive learning style rather than blitzing through a textbook?
- I'm starting to build up a list of commands, but I'm not sure how I could structure them or keep them together in a cohesive manner all in once place.

## Applications and Next Steps:
- To work on the Archive Management and Symbolic and Hard Link tasks tomorrow
- Find other interactive Linux learning resources that I can splash into.
- Figure out a way in which I can practically use the skills that I'm learning on the Linux terminal.
	- Perhaps making some kind of program or service?
- Practice the skills I've learned in a practice scenario without using references.

## What I Learned Today - 01/01/25:
## Key Insights:
- I finished the two practical exercises on Archive Management and Symbolic Links.
- I learned about commands related to compression, file management, working through multi-level folders without changing directory to them speeding up my workflow.
- I got an idea of how links work and that they are either references to a physical part of data with hard links or a pointer to another link in the context of symbolic links
- Inodes are unique system identifiers for links to files.
## Questions or Confusions:
- It's great knowing this knowledge, but I'm finding it difficult to understand the practical application of it - maybe I'm just not at a high enough level yet.
- Understanding material doesn't seem to be the hard part - but more synthesising it into my brain.

## Applications and Next Steps:
- Using more active recall and Anki note cards to improve retention.
- Summarising and clearing up notes so that they are as concise, yet sufficiently detailed.
- I want something practical that I can build and sink my teeth into, but I'm not sure what would be good or if I even have enough skills at this point.
