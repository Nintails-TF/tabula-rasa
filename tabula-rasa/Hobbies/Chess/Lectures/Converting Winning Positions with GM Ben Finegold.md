# Converting Winning Positions with GM Ben Finegold

There are three things you can do if you know that you are winning:
1. Do nothing and play chess.
2. Get very cautiously.
3. Prevent tricks and don't go for crazy tactics.

Look at which position is better, You can look at pieces activity, pawn structure, king safety, passed pawns. These tend to be good indicators.

Going for attacks on the opposing king can be good, since your opponent won't have enough pieces to defender.
