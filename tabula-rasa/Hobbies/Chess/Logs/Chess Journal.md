*Very frustrating in k+p endgames when the king is either in the a or h file, blocking the pawn. I have no clue how to draw k+p endgames other that try maintain opposition, in the trickier situations I feel lost.*

*I'm proud that how even on the first day, I'm becoming quicker at spotting ideas and the correct moves to win endgames. I think 75% winning is a good start.*
