# Nutrition, Consistency, and Sleep
## 1. Training Consistency (100%)

Perfect training consistency goes beyond just showing up for every workout—it's about quality execution and smart progression.

**Key optimization strategies:**
- **Follow the 80/20 rule strictly** - Ensure 80% of your training is truly easy (Zone 1-2) and 20% is quality work (Zone 3-5)
- **Use a training log** - Track every workout with notes on how you felt and recovery status
- **Implement "flex weeks"** - Every 4 weeks, reduce volume by 20-30% to allow deeper recovery
- **Modify instead of skipping** - If life interrupts a workout, do a shortened version rather than zero
- **Heart rate monitoring** - Use HR data to ensure you're training in the correct zones
- **Progressive overload** - Increase volume by no more than 10% weekly
- **Injury prevention** - Include 10-15 minutes of strength work 2-3 times weekly focusing on hips, core, and glutes
- **Specific adaptations** - Target your workouts to the demands of half-marathon racing (tempo runs at goal pace)

## 2. Nutrition Optimization

Nutrition for optimal performance involves daily habits, workout-specific fuelling, and recovery strategies.

**Key optimization strategies:**

- **Daily carbohydrate periodization:**
    - Hard training days: 6-8g/kg of body weight
    - Easy/recovery days: 4-5g/kg
    - Rest days: 3-4g/kg
- **Protein timing and quantity:**
    - 1.6-2.0g/kg daily, spread across 4-5 meals/snacks
    - 20-30g high-quality protein within 30 minutes after key workouts
- **Workout-specific nutrition:**
    - Long runs: 30-60g carbs per hour during runs over 75 minutes
    - Speed sessions: Easily digestible carbs 1-2 hours before
    - Recovery runs: Less critical, but avoid fasted training when fatigued
- **Hydration strategy:**
    - Daily baseline of ~3 litres of fluid
    - Pre-workout: ~500ml 2 hours before, ~250ml 15 minutes before
    - During: ~500ml per hour (more in heat)
    - Post-workout: Rehydrate with 1.5x fluid lost
- **Micronutrient focus:**
    - Iron (especially for female runners) - regularly consume iron-rich foods
    - Calcium - for bone health during high-impact training
    - Vitamin D - for immunity and bone health
    - Antioxidants - from colourful fruits and vegetables for recovery

## 3. Sleep Quality

Sleep is the foundation of recovery and adaptation, and optimizing it requires consistency and deliberate habits.

**Key optimization strategies:**

- **Quantity benchmarks:**
    - Minimum 7 hours nightly (8-9 hours ideal during peak training)
    - Additional 30-60 minutes on days following intense workouts
- **Consistency practices:**
    - Set a sleep/wake schedule (same times every day, even weekends)
    - Morning sunlight exposure (15+ minutes) to regulate circadian rhythm
    - Evening wind-down routine (30-60 minutes)
- **Environmental optimization:**
    - Room temperature: 60-67°F (15.5-19.5°C)
    - Complete darkness (blackout curtains or sleep mask)
    - Noise control (white noise machine if needed)
    - Electronic curfew (no screens 60 minutes before bed)
- **Training-specific sleep strategies:**
    - Schedule hardest workouts when you can get the most recovery sleep after
    - Strategic napping (20-30 minutes) between split sessions
    - Limit caffeine after noon
    - Time evening workouts to finish at least 2-3 hours before bedtime

## Synergistic Implementation

The real magic happens when these three factors work together. For example:
- Use sleep tracking to identify when you're not fully recovered, then adjust training intensity accordingly.
- Increase carbohydrate intake on days following poor sleep to compensate for reduced glycogen storage.
- Schedule your most carb-dependent workouts (long runs, intervals) when you've had optimal sleep.
- After particularly demanding sessions, prioritize both immediate nutrition and additional sleep.
