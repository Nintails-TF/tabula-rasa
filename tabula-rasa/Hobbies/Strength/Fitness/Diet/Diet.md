# Diet:

Currently I'm at 2300 calories and consuming 140gs of protein per day and just slotting in other macros here and there, I'm cutting at the moment, whilst training for the first time and I'm able to keep increasing weights every time I go and lift.

My PT Cameron said that if I plateau and can't lift any more, then we can increase the amount of calories into the body gradually. 

Wondering if there is anything I could optimise more.

My diet should be high in foods that have anti-inflammatory effects:
- Omega-3 fatty acids
	- Salmon, Mackerel, Sardines
	- Flaxseed, Chia seeds, walnuts
- Vitamins A, C, E,
	- Peppers, Tomatoes, Carrots, Beetroot (colourful vegetables)
		- Capsanthin, Lycopene, Betalains
- Vitamin K
	- Kale, Spinach, Collard greens, Swiss chard, cheese, Greek yogurt, grass fed eggs/organ meat/butter
		- Vitamin K1 (phylloquinone), K2 (menaquinones)
- Sulforaphane
	- Broccoli, Cauliflower, Brussel sprouts (cruciferous vegetables)
- Antioxidants
	- Blueberries, strawberries, blackberries
		- Anthocyanins, Resveratrol, Quercetins
- Polyphenols
	- Coffee and tea are fine, Green tea is better.
- Whole Grains
	- Oats, Quinoa, Barley
		- avenanthramides, quercetin, kaempferol
	- Brown rice and wholewheat pasta are more neutral for inflammation
		- Pairing them with other anti-inflammatory foods is ideal.
- Monounsaturated fat
	- Olive oil, Avocados, 
- Anti-inflammatory spices
	- Curcumin (Turmeric + Ginger)
- Fermented foods
	- Yogurt, kefir, sauerkraut, kimchi, etc.
- **Copper**
	- Since I take a high amount of zinc through supplementation, I need to ensure adequate copper levels.
		- Pumpkin seeds, dark chocolate (85%), Chickpeas, liver, cashews,

I also want to increase the amount of EPO (Erythropoietin) in my body, so that would mean:

- Iron + Vitamin C for plant sources
	- 45mg upper limit is practically impossible to hit without supplementations.
- Vitamin B12, B9 (Folate), 
	- Animal produce contains your B12, eggs are a good source of both folate and B12.

- Manuka Honey
	- The higher the MGO content, the more effect you are going to get. But the more bitter taste you'll get. 300, 525. 850 MGO are solid amounts.


## Hierarchy of Foods:

To reduce symptoms of inflammation, the following foods from my diet are best to incorporate regularly.

### Tier 1:

1. Fatty Fish (Salmon, Mackerel, Sardines)
	- EPA and DHA omega-3 fatty acids
	- Reduces inflammatory markers like CRP and IL-6
	- 2-3 servings per week ideally.
2. Berries (Blueberries, Blackberries, Strawberries)
	1. Anthocyanins and polyphenols.
	2. Inhibits NF-kB signalling pathways. Reducing oxidative stress and inflammation markers.
	3. 1 cup daily.
3. Turmeric (with black pepper)
	1. Curcumin is a very potent anti-inflammatory. Black pepper increases absorption by 2000%.
	2. Inhibits COX-2, LOX, TNF-alpha, and other inflammatory markers
	3. 1-2 teaspoons daily.
4. EVOO (Extra Virgin Olive Oil)
	1. Contains oleocanthal, works similarly to ibuprofen.
	2. Oleic acid and polyphenols.
	3. Reduces CRP and IL-6 levels.
	4. 2-3 Tablespoons daily.
5. Tart Cherries
	- Contain high levels of anthocyanins and cyanidin
	- Particularly effective for exercise-induced inflammation
	- Clinical studies show reduced muscle soreness and recovery time
	- Effective dose: 1 cup cherries daily or 240ml-350ml tart cherry juice.

### Tier 2:
1. **Leafy Greens** (Kale, Spinach, Collards)
    - Rich in vitamin K, antioxidants, and nitrates
    - Decrease inflammatory cytokine production
    - Effective dose: 2-3 cups daily
2. **Nuts** (Especially Walnuts)
    - Contain ALA omega-3s, vitamin E, and L-arginine
    - Walnuts specifically reduce multiple inflammatory markers
    - Effective dose: 1-2 oz (small handful) daily
3. **Cruciferous Vegetables** (Broccoli, Brussels sprouts, Cauliflower)
    - Rich in sulforaphane which activates Nrf2 pathway
    - Reduces oxidative stress and inflammation
    - Effective dose: 1-2 cups daily
4. **Ginger**
    - Contains gingerols that inhibit inflammatory producing enzymes
    - Particularly effective for pain reduction
    - Effective dose: 1-2 teaspoons fresh ginger daily
5. **Green Tea**
    - Contains EGCG and other catechins
    - Inhibits pro-inflammatory cytokine production
    - Effective dose: 3-4 cups daily

### Tier 3:
1. **Fermented Foods** (Yogurt, Kefir, Sauerkraut, Kimchi)
    - Support gut microbiome health
    - Reduce intestinal inflammation which can affect systemic inflammation
    - Effective dose: 1/2 cup daily
- **Avocados**
    - Rich in monounsaturated fats and carotenoids
    - Shown to reduce NF-ÎºB inflammatory signalling
    - Effective dose: 1/2 - 1 avocado daily
- **Mushrooms** (Especially Shiitake and Reishi)
    - Contain beta-glucans and ergothioneine
    - Modulate immune system function
    - Effective dose: 1-2 cups weekly
- **Dark Chocolate** (70%+ Cocoa)
    - Rich in flavanols that reduce oxidative stress
    - Moderate anti-inflammatory effect through multiple pathways
    - Effective dose: 1-2 squares (0.5-1 oz) daily
- **Garlic and Onions**
    - Contain organosulfur compounds (allicin)
    - Inhibit inflammatory mediators
    - Effective dose: 1-2 cloves garlic or 1/4 cup onions daily
