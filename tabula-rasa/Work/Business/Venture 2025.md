# Business Idea:

**Idea:**
A map based food resources for students which can show and look for all of the restaurants/coffee shops/etc in town. With an emphasis and focus on low prices and dietary filters in a clean package.

Could do the same thing with supermarkets and grocery shopping as well.

(Could do real-time price updates or work with local businesses to give deals/discounts.)

I've had friends who have specific dietary requirements and everyone is skint nowadays so it seems like a decent idea.

**What could I do that Yelp/Google Maps/Other resources don't do?**
1. Provide actual prices when users are searching of.
	1. e.g. If they are searching for "pizza" find a pizza location that is close to them, has decent reviews on an aggregate website like TripAdvisor, Yelp and show them what the price is for a pizza.
	2. Google maps gives a price range, whilst yelp gives a rating using £ signs. (£-££££).
2. Provide locations that are dietary friendly
	1. Enable users to quickly see and search for food that meet dietary requirements. Vegetarian, vegan, halal, etc.
3. Provide tracking price changes
	1. Show users if prices have gone down or up for local restaurants or in the region as a whole.
4. Give a rating for establishment.
	1. Based on value for money, quality, etc.

Work with universities to promote the app/website to students as a helpful resource.

**Monetization:**
- Advertisements
- Allow local food establishments to promote
- Affiliate with food delivery services, like uber eats to streamline ordering.
	- e.g. Have a button which says - order via uber eats or something.

**Marketing:**
- Market the app through the university through talking with DUSA, support services, etc. To get them to add it as a resource.
	- I recently saw that DUSA had to close down their breakfast club and pantry items. There is probably a gap in the market for people to find cheap food/resources.
