[Poor manâ€™s way to get rich. Not the easy way but it works.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyDKf9O32zk)

High ceiling industry and results oriented.

1. No shortcuts / commitment
	1. You aren't going to get shit in only 1-2 years of doing something. You need to be a master of your craft for anybody to give a shit about you.
2. Integrity / Accountability
	1. They way you do anything is the way you do everything. Let me show you that you can count on me and when they do, they will commit to spending money on you.
3. Value
	1. Understanding what the customer/teacher/boss wants. How you can solve that problem.
	2. It isn't your job to tell the person what they can or can't do, use the resources you can and the skills you have to make it happen, or to try make it happen. Make sure you are getting paid for it though.

10 years minimum to make a company you need the skills and expertise.
