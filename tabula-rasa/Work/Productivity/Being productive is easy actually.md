# Notes:

The main idea of the video is the motivation and work cycle, in which doing work or tasks, gives you a reward and then motivates you to do more work.

## Dealing with Low Motivation:

1. **What is this all for?**
2. **Remember what you enjoy about your work/task**
3. **Challenge yourself to get x amount of work done in y amount of time.**
4. **Make work into a habit**
	1. So when you wake up you do certain things, you can slot work into them.

Do one minute of work. At least even if you feel like doing nothing. Usually, you'll find that you actually don't mind once you start.

## When the Cycle Falls Apart:

 There are a few emotions or feelings that can make the cycle fall apart.

1. Tiredness
	1. Ideally sleep, otherwise caffeine can substitute this for a bit.
2. Confusion
	1. Have a to do list and a plan
3. Boredom
	1. Change music or background sounds
	2. Change location
	3. Change task - not an excuse to avoid things though!
4. Anxiety
	1. Self-questioning, ask yourself.
		1. What am I worried about?
		2. Is it reasonable?
		3. Will it matter in the long run?
		4. What can I control?
5. Distractions
	1. Put your phone in another room
	2. Personally, because of the depression and anhedonia, I don't feel good doing anything except exercise.
6. Frustrated
	1. Doing some kind of exercise.
	2. Asking for help or taking a step back.
	3. Adjusting your expectations or approach.
		1. Big one, lofty expectations can lead to pain when you end up tripping on pebbles.

Doing exercise here is king since it hits everything.
