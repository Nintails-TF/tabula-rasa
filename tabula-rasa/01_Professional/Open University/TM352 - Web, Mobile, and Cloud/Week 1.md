# 1. Introduction:

The purpose of this first block is to build some foundational skills required for the rest of the module as well as getting used to the technology used within the module.

This mainly refers to the **OpenComputing Lab** which is a cloud service that the OU runs.

***
# 2. Aims:

- accessed all the resources you will use in this block
- been introduced to the OpenComputing Lab, which you will use to undertake the block’s practical activities
- gained an awareness of what software is required, if you wish to undertake the practical activities on your own hardware.

# 3. OpenComputing Lab:

The **OpenComputing Lab** (OCL) is an online pre-configured suite of tools provided by the open university. It's the environment where assignments are tested, so it's best practice to do work within it and get used to it.

See [[OCL - OU Notes]] for more details on OCL configuration or quirks. It generally seems quite simple to setup, you get dropped into a vscode environment.

# 4. Weekly Tasks:

## 4.1. Exploring the Virtual Coding Environment:

The **Virtual Coding Environment** (VCE) opens in the `block_1` folder, that you'd usually want to stay in. The structure of the folder is:

- `skeletons` - Includes templates and example pieces of work
	- Note that this will be overwritten and replaced with defaults if you change anything during instance spawning. e.g. Don't save your work here.
- `work` - This is your working area for all Block 1 activities.
	- This space is persistent throughout sessions.

Generally, you'll be asked to copy a piece of work from the skeleton, analyse the code and copy it into your `work` and make changes on it. You can always scrap and replace your work with the skeleton templates if you get stuck.
