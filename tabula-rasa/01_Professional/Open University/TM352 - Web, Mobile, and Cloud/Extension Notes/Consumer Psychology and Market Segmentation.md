# Consumer Psychology and Market Segmentation

## Psychographic Profiling:

The practice of categorising consumers based on psychological attributes—values, attitudes, interests, and lifestyle—rather than purely demographic factors like age or income.

## Lifestyle Clustering:

Consumer behaviours, demographics, and preferences cluster together in a somewhat predictable manner. Where you live, what you earn, what you buy, how you spend your free time. Can be condensed into identifiable patterns.

Marketing firms have built systems for this such as the ([VALS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VALS) [PRIZM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claritas_Prizm), etc).
## Habitus:

The Idea of Habitus comes from French sociologist [Pierre Bourdieu:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Bourdieu)

Your class position, education, and social environment shapes your tastes, dispositions, and life trajectory in a way that feels like personal choice. The introverted kid in the 80s who got introduced into computers was shaped by a moment in time, that appealed to them and produced a predictable outcome down the line.

## Cohort Effects:

People who came of age during specific technological, economic, or cultural moments share formative experiences that shape lifelong preferences and behaviours. You can think of this as the WoW generation, Hippies, Instagram-Stoics, Andrew Tate's, etc.

The cohort effect has changed as media has become less centralised, but it still exists.

Another factor is transitional periods. People who knew the world before and after 9/11 versus people who only lived before (Or have patterns so entrenched that they can't/won't change them) or after it (to young to remember or understand). Apply this to different major events.

## Life Trajectory Bundling:

Career path, social style, spending habits, hobbies, and relationship patterns aren't independent variables—they're interconnected systems. The same disposition that draws someone toward solitary technical work also shapes their entertainment preferences, financial situation, and consumer behaviour.

# The Grounding Principle:

Do note that these tools are useful heuristics for resource allocation at some element of scale. They don't do well in predicting the behaviour of an individual, but can predict groups.

Also, that some of this borders on the theory-practice gap. You can define these and understand these concepts, but if it doesn't make a practical difference or enable action, then it is pointless.

**You must ride the line between academic terminology and understanding through learning that changes what you do.**

Measurable outcomes resist this - it's why soft sciences (Sociology, cultural studies, critical theory, branches of psychology, education theory, management theory) pretend as if they have rigour, the mimic hard science without the substance of any concrete evidence.

Engineering, medicine, hard science, computer science all have feedback which reality reflects. If you code doesn't compile or runs slow, if your patient dies, if your bridge collapses, if the particle acts in a certain way.

**Grounded Knowledge** has contact with reality that can push back. Ideas that don't work get discarded or refined. The business loses money, the code crashes, the patient doesn't get better.

**Ungrounded Knowledge** lacks this - it can be fact checked, defended by argument, supported by citation, elaborated, but never checked against anything external. This creates ideas that persist on social dynamics rather than accuracy - ideas that are compelling, fit frameworks, serves professional interests, even if untrue.

**What could prove this wrong?** If nothing could or that's the wrong question to ask, the idea is ungrounded.

**What changes if I believe this?** If nothing practical, then the idea is interesting, but has no real traction or impact in the world.
