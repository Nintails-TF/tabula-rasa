# Word Counts and Referencing:

Note, that this module doesn't accept 10%+- word count and that they want word counts at the bottom of submitted text.

References are not included in word count, captions and titles are not included in the word count.

References from outside the course will garner higher marks and are encouraged, as it shows engagement with material.

Use Harvard Cite Them Right for references.

## Large Language Models:

- Assessments require you to prove you are **not a Large Language Model** by demonstrating real understanding.
- Each assessment will include a **case study** with practical facts you must reference.
- To earn marks, you must show both **theoretical knowledge** and **practical application**.
- For each point:
    - Write **1–2 sentences** explaining the relevant theory.
    - Then write **2–3 sentences** showing **how that theory applies** to the specific facts of the case study.
- Answers that **don’t apply theory to the case study** will receive **limited marks**.
