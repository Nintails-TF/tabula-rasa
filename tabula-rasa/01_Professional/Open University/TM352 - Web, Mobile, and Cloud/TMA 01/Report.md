# TMA 01:


## Question 1: Prototype Web Applications:

## Question 2: Framework Comparison:

## Question 3: Development Report:

**Which of the two frameworks did you work on first and why?:**

I started with Svelte, as it offers a much cleaner and more intuitive approach for beginners than React, with built-in reactivity that works simply by assigning to variables, rather than relying on hooks or complex state patterns. It's going to be easier for me to get something up and running with svelte first, then moving towards React once I've got the code and architecture down in Svelte.

In reality it would really depend on the size of IAMC if a Svelte approach or React approach would be my first choice in business. Larger enterprise solutions would benefit from the ecosystem of React and developer familiarity, where as Svelte would have an edge to spin something up quicker.

**Which framework would you prefer and why?**

I prefer Svelte as it's less verbose and does the heavier lifting for me, giving me more time to spend problem solving issues and developing features for the IAMC.
