# Week 8 - Mobile Apps:

# 1. Introduction:

The goal of this weeks module is to learn about the different types of mobile apps and how they are developed, along with how to setup a development environment and build a simple mobile application.

The TMA 02 assignment involves building a mobile app using React Native.

***
# 2. Aims:

**Learning Outcomes:**
- Compare and contrast approaches, tools and techniques used to create mobile apps
- Install and configure a hybrid mobile app software build environment.

***
# 3. Mobile Apps:

Mobile apps have two main types:

1. **Native**
	1. Native mobile apps are apps that are hosted on the Google Play Store or the Apple App Store; they are platform dependant.
2. **Web-based**
	1. Web-based mobile apps run within a browser and simulate the functionality of a mobile app.

From these approaches, different forms of mobile development have formed:

3. **Hybrid**
	1. Hybrid mobile apps use web-based technologies (JS, CSS, HTML, etc) but place this content within a native app container.
	2. So a container is written in Swift/Objective-C for iOS or Java/Kotlin for Android. These containers then run a **WebView** component which runs the web-based code.
		1. This container acts as a bridge between web code and native device features.
4. **Progressive Web Apps** (PWAs)
	1. PWAs are enhanced web apps that can be installed without app stores, and have native feel and functionality. They are also platform independent.
5. **Cross-platform native**
	1. Technologies like React Native & Flutter compile code to native. Meaning you get native UI whilst being platform independent.
	2. Unlike hybrid apps, You don't interact via a browser but actual native phone UI components and widgets.
## 3.1. Native Apps:

The core advantages of native apps is that: they can be distributed through proprietary application stores, thus have quality control through rating and feedback. Additionally, they are more likely to work efficiently and utilise the full features of the target OS (GPS, microphones, accelerometers, etc).

The main disadvantage of native apps is that the are more time consuming to port to other platforms and are more difficult to develop than web apps.

Native applications are best suited to providing a rich client experience. As they can support more widgets than a browser can, they allow user experience not possible via web apps, provide standardisation of UI controls this enables for them to achieve a look which is accepted and feel like that of the operating system's applications.

Web applications can have a common look across all devices, whereas Native apps offer additional security and privacy settings, such as restricting the number of permissions needed for the app to function. For instance: a web app needs internet access where as a Native app may not need it.

Another feature of native apps is needing to interface with the major mobile app platforms (Android and iOS phones) both of which require specialised skillsets.
