# Week 9 - The Consumer Market
## 1. Introduction:

Mobile technologies aren't just the hardware and software used to make a physical device. They also include the knowledge and skills to use it, and the methods and markets that distribute it. Technology in this sense is only useful if people can acquire it and use it.

---

## 2. Aims:

The three key aims of this week are the following:

1. Critically evaluate the consumer mobile market.
2. Define the term [[../TM352 Glossary#^Consumerisation-def|Consumerisation]] and how it relates to mobile devices.
3. Compare and contrast the different kinds of mobile devices used in the developed and developing world.

## 3. The Consumer Market:

The [[../TM352 Glossary#^Consumer-Market-def|Consumer Market]] is made up of individuals and groups who buy items and services for personal use (or consumption). In essence, children who walk into a sweet store are consumers of sweets as are adults looking to buy a new smartphone in the smartphone market. 

> We are all consumers to an extent - some more than others.

For example: Most students have a smartphone, if you don't you are part of a small and shrinking minority. There can be many reasons why a student doesn't have a smartphone: *Price, ideology, too complicated, risks outweigh benefits, etc.*

I believe a big factor is **dependency avoidance**, many young people have seen their friends be unable to function without a smartphone, they don't want that for them. So they abstain to avoid being sucked into the screen - through social media/instant internet access/etc.
### 3.1. Consumer Characteristics and Technology Adoption:

We can use the term of [[../TM352 Glossary|Laggard]] to describe students who do not have a smartphone or tablet. These terms were introduced by Everett Rodgers in 1962, he classified adaptors of technical innovations as the following:

![[../../../../03_Reference/Pictures/Pasted image 20260124140845.png]]

Each size and section are described as the following:

- **Innovators** (2.5%) - Are the first to use an innovation. They are venturesome and positively thrive on risk. They socialise outside their peer group and look outward in other fields. They don't let setbacks stop their enthusiasm for the new.
- **Early Adopters** (13.5%) - Are respected within their local peer network and act as role models for that network of groups or individuals. They are agents of change who see the practical application before the majority and make relatively quick decisions regarding it's usefulness.
- **Early Majority** (34%) - Adopt just before the average and deliberate for sometime before adopting. They are more cautious and are followers rather than leaders.
- **Late Majority** (34%) - Are even more sceptical and cautious than the early majority. They require most of the uncertainty and risk regarding an innovation to be removed before they will adopt.
- **Laggards** (16%) - Are the last to adopt. They are suspicious of innovations, and of change in general. They typically have limited resources and so must be certain that an innovation will not fail before they adopt.

A good example of this, has been the uptake of generative AI - how people in the technology industry first used it, then computing science students, then it widened out to the general public. I would say I was the early majority, I got influenced by the innovators/early adopters in my friend circle - I knew of Gen AI before the public did, though I didn't use it as frequently, after seeing what my friends were using it for. Now, I use it everyday and pay for premium the premium models.

The adopter categories aren't just personality fixed, but are domain-specific. You've got categories of people who have certain traits which push them towards different parts of the model. Take the sci-fi nerd, they may be innovators or early adopters within their niche, but laggards elsewhere

This introduces ideas of [[../Extension Notes/Consumer Psychology and Market Segmentation|Consumer Psychology and Market Segmentation.]]

#### 3.1.1. Reflecting on Where You Are in the Model:

Populations can be expressed either as **geographical** (Worldwide, nation, region, etc) or **demographical** (age, gender, etc.). In our example, we pick students as our demographic, and classify anyone who doesn't have a smartphone in 2026 as a laggard.

[(Moore, 1999)](https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Crossing_the_Chasm.html?id=cj7EQgAACAAJ&redir_esc=y) modified Rogers' model by including a chasm, showing a gap between early adopters and early majority. This chasm highlights the big difference in characteristics between innovators/early adopters and other types.

Innovators/Early adopters are people who are targeted with the early releases of a "product". Their feedback is used to determine what features are useful or not. They can see the future benefits of the technology/product and their attitude + skills allow them to deal with off-putting inconveniences such as bugs, prototype interfaces, etc.

The mainstream market is what makes a product profitable or not - they are most pragmatic and require higher standards. There must be: reliability, complete set of features, user-friendly interface, and a benefit to justify the cost. A product that **just works.**

Crossing the chasm could take a very long time, or may never happen at all. The modern IT industry as an example, many innovations were regarded as failures because they didn't see mass adoption early. 

If you look back on the time line of the PC, mobile phones, internet adoption. You can see that the chasm can take some time to cross:

**Personal Computer (PC)**
- Innovators/Early Adopters (1974–1980) → Crossed Chasm (1985–1990) → Early Majority (1990–1995)
	- 21 Years

**Mobile Phone**
- Innovators/Early Adopters (1983–1995) → Crossed Chasm (1996–1999) → Early Majority (1999–2005)
	- 10 Years

**Internet/World Wide Web**
- Innovators/Early Adopters (1969–1993) → Crossed Chasm (1994–1997) → Early Majority (1998–2001)
	- 31 Years

AI interestingly is moving at such a fast pace, it's taken about 3 years to reach the early majority stage. This is for a few reasons:

1. No infrastructure needed.
2. No friction to try - just type question into textbox.
3. Immediate obvious value.
4. Built on top of other existing trends (Mobile texting, messaging apps, etc.)

AI is a **service**, not a product.

### Taxi-Sharing App - Example:

#### 1. Market Population

Open University employees who regularly travel between Milton Keynes Central station and Walton Hall campus—a bounded institutional community with a shared destination.

#### 2. Target Users for Prototype

Innovators and early adopters: tech-comfortable staff who already use similar apps, those frustrated with taxi costs, environmentally motivated employees, and socially outgoing colleagues who'd enjoy the networking aspect. They'll tolerate imperfections and become visible advocates for more cautious users.

#### 3. Features for Early and Late Majority

**Early majority:** Proven reliability, evidence of colleague uptake, simple interface, privacy controls, integration with existing systems.

**Late majority:** Official institutional endorsement, very low friction (automatic matching), strong data protection assurances, integration with University travel systems, clear evidence of tangible savings. Block/Friend lists, etc.

#### 4. Concern about Laggards?

Not particularly. The app doesn't need universal adoption to succeed—partial uptake still delivers economic and environmental benefits. As long as alternatives remain available, non-adopters aren't a barrier.

#### 5. Similar Existing Apps

Yes: BlaBlaCar, Liftshare, Waze Carpool, and Enterprise Rideshare. Most focus on car owners sharing vehicles rather than taxi sharing among non-drivers. Liftshare's corporate programmes come closest. The OU app's narrow focus is both a limitation and a strength.

This introduces a good filter for any product idea: **Can this be replaced with existing tools and some social coordination?** (WhatsApp group + Flyer or digital announcement/emails).

### 3.2. Chasm-Crossing Mobile Device:

The iPhone was the first real smartphones in the minds of people. The touch-screen keyboard was a real game changer as well as other features packaged together which made it useful.

The mobile web at the time was really limited tough, especially prior to the iPhone. Most where used to check email, sports-scores, or weather forecasts. But the iPhone could display "desktop webpages", which wasn't perfect at the time, but you could zoom in and out.

You had many different features all in one: the touchscreen, music player, camera, web browser, and mobile phone. You could use GPS, accelerometers, etc.

Innovation is like Lego. You've got little blocks that you fit together to build something. Then someone builds prototype of a functional marble race machine or a gun out of it. Then you build your own new Lego bricks to make it better.

### 3.3. Augmented Product:

The design and the shape of the iPhone wasn't the only factor that separated it from the competition. it was the non-physical factors at play.

We can classify a product as being an
