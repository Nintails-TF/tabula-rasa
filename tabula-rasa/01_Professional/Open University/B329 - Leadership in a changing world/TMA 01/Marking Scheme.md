# Marking Scheme

**Part A** will be assessed in the following way (**60 marks** available):

- Catchy title and image – **5 marks**. Your blog post should have a catchy title, using no more than ten words, and there should be an appealing image included within the main body of the post, ideally at the beginning or in the middle of it. (You can use an image that you find online but please remember to cite the source.) In writing the title, you should take the perspective of external readers, stakeholders and media, and try to grab their attention.
- Logical structure and audience – **5 marks**. The blog post should follow the ‘inverted pyramid’ structure described in Week 5. Your intended audience should also be clear (e.g. employers of people in precarious jobs, politicians working on immigration issues, the general public, etc.).
- Key argument and call to action – **10 marks**. Your blog post should convey one key argument, presented at the beginning (the Lead), and a call to action, presented at the end (the Tail). The call to action should refer to a contemporary societal challenge/social issue. By contemporary we mean an issue/challenge which is discussed in the public sphere (television, newspapers, social media, etc.) during the period of the current B329 presentation.
- Critical application of two module concepts – **30 marks**: The body of the blog post should also make reference to and explain two module concepts presented in Block 1 that are relevant to the key argument of your post. Some examples of module concepts are turbulence; complexity leadership theory; adaptive leadership; precarity; populism; [charismatic leadership](https://learn2.open.ac.uk/mod/glossary/showentry.php?eid=1410234&displayformat=dictionary "Glossary: Charismatic leadership"); and culture. (You may use other module concepts presented in Block 1.) You need to write the two module concepts chosen in _italics_ anytime you mention them in the blog post. Only the concepts (for example: _turbulence; charismatic leadership_) should be in _italics_ not the whole sentence where the concepts are explained.
- Link with the planned interviewee – **10 marks**. Within the body of the blog post make reference to publicly available information about your chosen interviewee and the concepts.
- You will need to include a list of the sources you have referred to in the main text of your blog at the end of Part A. You will also need to include a full reference list for TMA 01 at the end of your assignment. Reference lists are not included in the word count.

**Part B** will be assessed in the following way (**20 marks** available):

- provision of information (practical details) about the planned interview and attachment of the interview questions in an appendix at the back of your TMA. Moreover, you should explain why you have chosen to interview that person; which two of the Block 1 concepts you would like to discuss with them; and what you expect to learn from the interview within a maximum of 350 words.

**Part C** will be assessed in the following way (**20 marks** available):

- a critically reflective review of your blog (maximum 350 words), using the critical thinking skills you studied in the five-steps process in Week 1, Activity 4. You should consider the following in your reflections:
    - i. The _question_ your blog is addressing
    - ii. The quality and breadth of _information_ you gathered, in particular how reliable were the sources
    - iii. How you used this information in your _main argument_, and anything you left out with reasons
    - iv. The _conclusions_ you reached in the blog and how the information supported these
    - v. Acknowledgement of any _other points of view_ you considered in addressing the question.
