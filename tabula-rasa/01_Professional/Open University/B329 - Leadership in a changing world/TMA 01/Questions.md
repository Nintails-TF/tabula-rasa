# Questions
Explain in no more than **350 words** your plan for the semi-structured interview activity you did in Week 5 of Block 1. This should include: an introduction to the leadership figure you would like to interview; which two Block 1 concepts you would like to discuss with them; and what you expect to learn from the interview beyond the information which is publicly available about them. You must append a full set of your proposed interview questions.

***


## My Leadership Figure:

I'm planning an interview Hannah Brise, a board member of the South of Scotland Enterprise Youth Advisory Forum (SOSE YAF). 

Hannah is a young person from Newton Stewart who has navigated significant personal challenges including struggling with confidence to apply for university and limited opportunities. Through her involvement with the YAF, she has developed as a leader and personally advocating for other youth leaders and herself more. Hannah represents a more adaptive form of leadership - one that builds collective power from the bottom up rather than traditional leadership.
## Two Block 1 Concepts

**1. Precarity:** The condition of economic and social instability affecting young people - unaffordable housing, zero-hour contracts, student debt, and pervasive uncertainty about the future. Precarity erodes hope and trust in traditional institutions.

**2. Populism:** Political movements that frame society as "virtuous people versus corrupt elite," often led by charismatic figures promising radical change. While populism identifies genuine grievances, it can offer scapegoats rather than systemic solutions.

## Expected Learning Beyond Public Information

I expect to learn how precarity feels lived and experienced by someone my age, not just as statistics. I want to understand whether young people facing economic instability and psychological instability feel vulnerable to populist appeals. Most importantly, I hope to discover how someone transforms frustration with "the system" into democratic participation rather than destructive politics, the middle path rather than apathy or destructive populism and radicalisation.

## Questions:

1. Researchers talk about young people facing a 'perfect storm' - unaffordable housing, zero-hour contracts, student debt. How do you see these issues playing out among people our age?
2. When you're working unstable jobs, can't afford a home, and don't know what next month looks like - how does that affect your ability to believe in a stable future?
3. Traditional politicians often promise to help young people, but conditions don't improve. Do you think young people still trust that mainstream parties are working for them?
4. Some people describe the current system as 'the elite' protecting their own interests while ordinary people struggle. Does that framing resonate with your experience?
5. When people feel ignored by traditional politics, they're attracted to leaders who promise to 'shake up the system.' Why does that message appeal to young people facing precarity?
6. Populist movements frame politics as 'virtuous people versus corrupt elite.' When you're struggling while seeing wealthy people get richer, does that narrative feel true?
7. Some researchers say precarity makes people more vulnerable to populist rhetoric. Do you think economic insecurity makes people willing to take risks on radical political solutions?
8. The Youth Advisory Forum seems like a different response - grassroots, collective, building power from the ground up. How is that different from following a populist leader who promises to fix everything?
9. You said the Forum gave you 'a voice on a table it wouldn't normally be on' - that sounds like challenging the establishment, which populists also claim to do. What's the difference between healthy democratic participation and destructive populism?
10. Do you think the answer to precarity is waiting for the right leader to save us, or young people organizing themselves to demand systemic change from the bottom up?
