# Rough Idea

**Why Young People Must Lead Themselves Today:**

Write about young people in the age of precarity and uncertainty. Can relate to the fact that young people feel as if they have to work harder, have less opportunities, and will struggle to afford housing.

> "Traditional leadership failed us. We must lead ourselves."

**Concepts:** Precarity/Precarious work + Adaptive Leadership vs Traditional Leadership.
**Interview:** YAF - Hannah Brise

**Call to action:** Advise young people to reach out to organisations that can help them grow and flourish, rather than organisations that exploit them. 

Encourage young people to step into leadership roles. Give them concrete ways of doing so.

## Questions:

**Ask Tutors/Form:**
Is it OK to have multiple pictures, e.g. a graph or visual representation and an initial striking image?
Is it OK to conduct an actual interview, rather than a planned interview if possible?

# Structure:

### Blog (800 words) - Suggested Flow:

**Lead (100 words)**:
- Hook with striking stat/quote from your friend interview
- Introduce youth precarity crisis
- Thesis: "Traditional leadership failed us. We must lead ourselves."

**Body (600 words)**:
- Define _**precarity**_ (150 words)
    - Use module definition
    - Evidence from your interviews + module material (housing crisis, etc.)

- Introduce YAF board member (200 words)
    - Their leadership journey
    - How they practice _**resistance leadership**_ or _**adaptive leadership**_
    - Define your second module concept here
    - Reference planned interview: "As [Name] explained in our conversation..."

- Contrast traditional vs youth-led approaches (200 words)
    - Why traditional leadership failed
    - What makes youth-led different
    - Evidence from OU peer responses

- Solutions emerging (50 words)
    - YAF and similar initiatives
    - Bridge to CTA

**Tail (100 words)**:
- Strong, specific CTA
- Concrete actions

### Interview Questions (350 words)

**Structure this as:**
- Brief intro (50 words): Who you're interviewing and why
- 8-12 questions grouped by theme:
    - **Their journey** (2-3 questions)
    - **Youth precarity** (3-4 questions)
    - **Leadership practice** (2-3 questions)
    - **Advice/solutions** (1-2 questions)
- Brief conclusion (50 words): What you hope to learn

### Reflection (350 words)

**Use Start/Stop/Continue framework:**
- What insights emerged from your multi-source approach
- How conducting real interviews changed your understanding
- Your own leadership journey (YAF application)
- How module concepts became real through your research

# Draft:

### **Opening (Set up the crisis):**

Zero-hour contracts. Algorithmic bosses. Unaffordable housing. Welcome to the expendable generation - where stability is a luxury and young people work harder for less, with no voice in the systems that exploit them.

"Young people in the UK face unprecedented precarity. Zero-hour contracts mean they can't plan next week, let alone next year. Housing costs have soared beyond reach. Student debt looms like a sword of Damocles. They work multiple jobs just to survive, with no stability, no security, and no voice in the systems that govern their lives.

When traditional institutions consistently fail people, they stop trusting them. They start looking for alternatives. And increasingly, those alternatives come in the form of populist movements - charismatic leaders promising to tear down the corrupt establishment and fight for 'the people.'"

### **Middle (Introduce Hannah & Interview Context):**

"But is populism the answer to precarity, or is it a dangerous trap? To explore this question, I planned an interview with Hannah Brise, a 24-year-old member of the SOSE Youth Advisory Forum. Hannah represents a generation caught between precarity and the pull of radical politics - young people who feel abandoned by the system and are searching for ways to create change."

### **After Interview Analysis:**

"Hannah's insights reveal the complex relationship between precarity and populism. When young people face constant economic insecurity, the populist narrative of 'virtuous people versus corrupt elite' feels true because it validates their lived experience. Charismatic leaders who promise quick, radical solutions become appealing because gradualism hasn't worked - why trust incremental change when you can't afford rent?

But as Hannah points out, not all responses to precarity are equal. Populist movements can be divisive, scapegoating vulnerable groups rather than addressing systemic causes. Charismatic leaders can become unaccountable, breaking promises once in power. The very desperation that makes populism appealing also makes people vulnerable to manipulation.

The Youth Advisory Forum represents an alternative: grassroots, collective organizing that builds power from the bottom up rather than waiting for a saviour from the top down."

### **Call to Action:**

"Young people don't need another charismatic leader promising easy answers. They need to organize collectively, demand systemic change, and refuse to let precarity drive them toward movements that divide rather than unite. The answer to feeling powerless isn't to hand power to a populist strongman - it's to build power together.

Join or create youth councils, tenant unions, worker cooperatives. Challenge the elite, yes - but do it through democratic participation, not destructive populism. Don't wait for someone to save you. Save yourselves, together."
