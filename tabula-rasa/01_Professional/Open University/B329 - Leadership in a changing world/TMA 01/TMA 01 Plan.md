# Rough Idea

**Why Young People Must Lead Themselves Today:**

Write about young people in the age of precarity and uncertainty. Can relate to the fact that young people feel as if they have to work harder, have less opportunities, and will struggle to afford housing.

> "Traditional leadership failed us. We must lead ourselves."

**Concepts:** Precarity/Precarious work + Adaptive Leadership vs Traditional Leadership.
**Interview:** YAF - Hannah Brise

**Call to action:** Advise young people to reach out to organisations that can help them grow and flourish, rather than organisations that exploit them. 

Encourage young people to step into leadership roles. Give them concrete ways of doing so.

## Questions:

**Ask Tutors/Form:**
Is it OK to have multiple pictures, e.g. a graph or visual representation and an initial striking image?
Is it OK to conduct an actual interview, rather than a planned interview if possible?
