## Your Strengths to Maintain

You got 79% because these were EXCELLENT:
- ✅ Conceptual understanding (precarity/populism analysis was sophisticated)
- ✅ Contemporary evidence (Resolution Foundation data was strong)
- ✅ Critical thinking (performative vs. ideological populism distinction)
- ✅ Authentic examples (Hannah Brise was perfect)
- ✅ Engaging writing (punchy, clear, accessible)

**The feedback wasn't about your understanding - it was about academic presentation conventions.**
