## From "Precarious Hope: Situated Perspectives on the COVID-19 Pandemic" (Nunn Et Al., 2021):

**On the pandemic's impact:**

- "The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on the lives of young people, transforming and disrupting education provision, employment opportunities, social practices, mobilities, and experiences of health and well-being."

**On pre-existing precarity:**

- "While this constellation of challenges is unique to the COVID-19 crisis, many issues were pre-existing, rendered visible or further exacerbated by the pandemic. In this context, the COVID-19 pandemic is yet another strand in the intersecting crises already shaping, constraining, and unsettling youth trajectories and futures."
- "As has been extensively evidenced in pre-pandemic youth studies research, young people's lives were already precarious" (p.430)

**On employment insecurity:**

- "Young people already face higher under/unemployment rates and are overrepresented in industries curtailed by public health measures, such as hospitality and retail. They are also more likely to be precariously employed and without access to formal entitlements and protections" (p.431)

**On mental health:**

- "More generally, young people report significant declines in mental health since the start of the pandemic, including increased anxiety and reduced ability to cope with life" (p.431)

**On individualisation:**

- "Our accounts are inflected with a sense of hope, grounded in the precarious present, which is oriented to social solidarity and individual and collective transformation for a more secure future... At the same time, our narratives capture a sense of precarious hope: hopefulness that is both a product of precarity and itself precarious" (p.440)

## From "Post-crisis precarity" (Berry & McDaniel, 2020):

**On the gig economy:**

- "The vast majority did not, when pressed, express concern about gig economy practices in general. Indeed, many again commented that the gig economy could be a good thing for certain groups, such as students or carers who did not want to commit to a job" (p.334)

**On attitudes to work:**

- "Despite the problems they were currently experiencing, it is illuminating that many participants expressed optimism about their own careers, particularly those in London. Some, especially graduates, expressed the view that the current labour market actually worked well for those equipped with the correct skills and qualifications, or the right attitude." (p.333)

**On navigating precarity:**

- "The danger, of course, is that these apparent benefits of contemporary labour market conditions serve to mask some of its less desirable elements. If participants are more willing to take responsibility for their own economic fate, rather than recognising the structural determinants of their present difficulties, they may also come to see more exploitative features of those conditions, associated with precarity, as normal or legitimate." (p.333-334)

**On trade unions:**

- "A participant in London commented: 'I feel, first of all, that things are pretty much okay, and, second of all, that maybe I won't be in this particular job long enough for it to make a big difference' [Female, FG London 1]. Another in the same group stated he had not joined a union yet because 'nothing bad's happened to me yet' [Male, FG London 1]." (p.334-335)

**Key finding:**

- "Precarious labour market conditions have been largely accepted by young adults in the UK... This does not mean, however, that labour market changes have been accepted passively or unknowingly... there is a recognition amongst these young people of the novelty of their socio-economic circumstances, and thus frustration and anger at the nature of these circumstances. Nevertheless, we also find, as others have, that young people feel that insecure labour market conditions are simply 'part and parcel' of the economic order" (p.336)

These quotes provide strong academic backing for discussions of youth precarity, the normalisation of insecure work, and the complex relationship young people have with their economic circumstances.

# False Starts - NEETs Growing Resolution Foundation:

## On the Scale of the Problem

> "In 2025, the topic of NEETs (young people not in education, employment or training) is back in the headlines. Like in the late 2000s, the number of young people aged 16-24 who are NEET has risen to just short of a million."

> "By 2025, more than one-in-eight young people were NEET (12.8 per cent), up from one-in-seven (11.5 per cent) in 2019."

## On Precarity and Changing Circumstances

> "In 2025, three-fifths of NEETs are inactive – that is, not looking for work – rather than unemployed. This marks a big shift from to the early 2010s when unemployment was the main reason."

> "The proportion of NEETs who are inactive due to sickness or disability has more than doubled since 2005, reaching more than a quarter (28 per cent) of all NEETs in 2025, while the proportion who are inactive due to 'other' reasons... also rose sharply during the same period to reach 23 per cent of all NEETs in 2025."

## On Young People's Barriers

> "Low qualifications aren't the only thing that are holding NEETs back from entering work or study, though. NEETs are also more likely than other young people to experience both mental- and physical-health problems, and to report lower wellbeing."

> "A growing proportion of have never had a paid job: 60 per cent of NEETs have never worked in 2025, up from 42 per cent in 2005. Altogether, this paints a worrying picture, of young people who face real, complex barriers to entering work or study."

## On Rising Risk Factors

> "Almost a quarter of children aged 11-16 now have a probable mental-health disorder; one-in-five secondary school pupils are persistently absent from school; and one-in-six secondary school pupils receive special educational needs (SEN) support."

> "These trends indicate that our next generation of 16-24-year-olds will have a heightened NEET risk."

## On Policy and Support Gaps

> "Nearly half (44 per cent) of NEETs do not engage with the benefits system. This raises the tricky question of how to design effective policy to engage with NEETs who have no reason to be in contact with the state."

> "While this big reduction in inactivity for caring reasons led to a welcome fall in women's NEET rate during the 2010s, the picture now looks much less positive, with inactivity for health and 'other' reasons rising for both young men and women."

## On Age-Specific Challenges

> "Those aged 16-17 are especially likely to be inactive for 'other' reasons – over the past three years this was the case for almost half (44 per cent) of 16-17-year-olds, compared to only a fifth of those aged 18-24."

> "Notably, while all young people aged 16-17 in England must participate in education or training following the Rising Participation Age (RPA) legislation introduced in 2013, their NEET rates haven't budged, fluctuating between 4 and 5 per cent in both 2013 and 2025."

## Key Statistics on Housing Precarity - Resolution Foundation.

**On declining home ownership:**

> "While more than half (53 per cent) of baby boomers born between 1961-65 were homeowners by age 30, that's true for just over a quarter (27 per cent) of millennials born between 1981-85."

**On housing tenure shifts:**

> "Between 1990 and 2022-23, the proportion of young people renting privately more than tripled, growing from 10 per cent to 33 per cent. Similarly, the share of 25-34-year-olds living with their parents rose from 16 per cent in the early 1990s, when home ownership rates for this age group were at their peak, to 22 per cent in 2022-23."

**On housing costs:**

> "Private renting is the most expensive form of housing tenure, with 25-34-year-olds in this sector spending an average of 31 per cent of their household income on housing costs, compared to just 12 per cent for mortgagors and 5 per cent for outright homeowners."

## Impact on Wellbeing and Financial Security

**On financial resilience:**

> "In 2018-20, the typical household headed by a 25-34-year-old had £3,000 in accessible savings. However, this figure more than doubled to £6,500 for those without housing costs, while those spending more than 30 per cent of their income on housing typically had just £700 in savings."

**On mental health:**

> "Higher housing costs as a share of income are also associated with worse mental health: only 1 per cent of those with no housing costs reported feeling anxious, compared to 13 per cent of those spending 30 per cent or more of their income on housing."

## Inequality and Regional Disparities

**On income inequality:**

> "The rise in youth home ownership rates in recent years has been concentrated among middle- and higher-income families, widening the income gap between those who benefit from home ownership and those who do not. In 2015-16, home ownership rates for those in the top third of the income distribution were 36 percentage points higher than for those in the lowest third, but this difference expanded to 39 percentage points by 2022-23."

**On regional disparities:**

> "More than two-fifths (43 per cent) of young Londoners spend over 30 per cent of their income on housing, compared to just 8 per cent of 25-34-year-olds in the North East."

> "Young people in London and the South East have also experienced only a modest recovery in home ownership rates in recent years, leaving home ownership among 25-34-year-olds in these regions at relatively low levels (19 per cent and 29 per cent, respectively)."

## Policy Context

**On government targets:**

> "It is, therefore, welcome that the Government has set an ambitious target to deliver 1.5 million new homes by the end of this Parliament and pledged to introduce a permanent mortgage guarantee scheme to help first-time buyers struggling with deposits and high costs."

***
## On Youth Employment and Minimum Wage Changes

**On youth minimum wage increases:**

> "Rates for younger workers will rise even faster – by 18 per cent for 16-17-year-olds and 16.3 per cent for 18-20-year-olds, as the Government pursues its policy of convergence with adult rates."

> "The 2025 increases in the youth rates are the largest ever, but the increases in the youth rates in 2024 were also large."

## On Economic Precarity and Labour Market Pressure

**On labour cost increases for low-wage workers:**

> "The combined impact of NICs and the minimum wage is significant: the overall increase in labour costs for employing a part-time adult minimum wage earner in April will be 14.2 per cent, the largest since the minimum wage began, in 1999."

> "Labour costs will rise by more among groups where hourly wages are low (where the minimum wage has a large effect), or where weekly earnings are low (where the employer NICs increase has a large effect)."

## On Employment Effects and Job Insecurity

**On employment risks for young workers:**

> "For workers in the bottom hourly pay quintile (whose hourly pay will be at or close to the minimum wage) we estimate that the number of hours worked will fall by 0.6 per cent."

> "Overall, we judge that the combined of NICs and the minimum wage increase will reduce total employment by 85,000."

**On sectors employing young people:**

> "Some examples of groups of workers where Government's policy changes will significantly raise labour costs (i.e. over and above economy-wide earnings growth) include: workers in hospitality (a 4.5 per cent increase) and in retail and wholesale (+3.9 per cent), women working part-time (+4.6 per cent), 16-20-year-olds (+5.4 per cent)."

## On Job Quality Concerns

**On potential impacts on work arrangements:**

> "The minimum wage could, in principle, drive down job quality. Alternative work arrangements can be a cost-saver for employers, so it's easy to see why this might be a response some make to increases in labour costs."

> "One study found a modest positive effect on the use of zero-hours contracts: the introduction of the 'National Living Wage' in 2016 (which raised the adult minimum wage by 10 per cent) increased the use of zero-hours contracts in social care by one percentage point (from 12 per cent)."

## On Recommendations for Youth Rates

**On maintaining youth minimum wage flexibility:**

> "The youth minimum wage rates should not be abolished. The fact that young workers (aged under 21) aren't affected by the employer NICs increase will mitigate employment risks this year, but there remains uncertainty about the impact of the Government's employment reforms on younger workers."
