Zero-hour contracts. Algorithmic bosses. Unaffordable housing. Welcome to the expendable generation - where stability is a luxury and young people work harder for less, with no voice in the systems that exploit them.

Young people in the UK face unprecedented *precarity* - the condition of living with uncertainty, instability, and vulnerability outside of their control. Destiny is slipping from their grasp; as businesses, governments, and economic forces hold the reigns of youth future and wellbeing. The cost of living crisis fuelled by: stagnant wages wages, energy price hikes, and Brexit trade friction, has squeezed young workers - a report from blah, shows this.

	- Between 1990 and 2022-23, the proportion of young people renting privately more than tripled, growing from 10 per cent to 33 per cent.
		- Private renting is the most expensive.
	- Over recent decades, house prices have risen far faster than wages across the UK, but the increase in house prices has been particularly steep in regions like London and the South East, which have seen the median house price as a proportion of household disposable income increase by 239 per cent and 104 per cent, respectively, since 1998-99.

	- We estimate that the number of NEETs aged 16-24 has risen sharply (by 195,000) between 2022-23 and 2024-25 to reach 940,000, reflecting falling labour-market participation and stalling education participation.
	- Employment and vacancies are falling most sharply in youth-heavy sectors of the economy. For example, while the total number of vacancies has fallen by 17 per cent over the last year, there were falls of 20 per cent in hospitality and 25 per cent in the arts, entertainment and recreation.
	- First, labour market participation among young people has been falling since 2022-23. In the latest data from August 2025,there were 3.80 million young people aged 16-24 in pay rolled employment, down from 3.98million three years earlier in August 2022, a fall of 178,000 (or 4.5 per cent). Second, after fast increases during the Covid-19 pandemic, increases in education participation have started to slow.

	- On April 1st, the adult minimum wage will rise by 6.7 per cent – the seventh-largest rise in 26 years.

	- Young people already face higher under/unemployment rates and are overrepresented in industries curtailed by public health measures, such as hospitality and retail. They are also more likely to be precariously employed and without access to formal entitlements and protections (Macdonald and Giazitzoglu 431 Journal of Applied Youth Studies (2021) 4:429–4441 32019)

	- Two-thirds of the growth in employment since 2008 has been in “atypical” roles such as self-employment, zero-hours contracts or agency work’ (Clarke and Cominetti, 2019: 6–7)
	- Specific concerns included low pay, poor job quality (particularly in the retail sector), unreasonable employer expectations, insecurity and, to some extent, the prospect of automation.
