Zero-hour contracts. Algorithmic bosses. Unaffordable housing. Welcome to the expendable generation - where stability is a luxury and young people work harder for less, with no voice in the systems that exploit them.

Young people in the UK face unprecedented *precarity* - the condition of living with uncertainty, instability, and vulnerability outside of their control. Destiny is slipping from their grasp; as businesses, governments, and economic forces hold the reigns of youth future and wellbeing. The cost of living crisis fuelled by: stagnant wages, ballooning housing prices, and Brexit trade friction, has squeezed young workers - research from Urban Studies and Resolution Foundation indicates: "Young people are half as likely to own homes as their parents" (Resolution Foundation, 2024, p.3) and "The implication for younger people can be the choice between homeownership and deciding to have children." (Wetzstein, 2017, p.3160).

In essence, what was once attainable for young people around the nation is now out of reach.

This shows no quick signs of changing, as government forces pushed back against a bill to ban 0-hour contracts. The House of Lords continues to strike back against the Employment Rights Bill (Moss, 2025), which would seek to improve the working conditions of many young people across the UK.
