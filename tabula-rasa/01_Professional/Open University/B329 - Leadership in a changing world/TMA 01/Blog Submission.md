# No House, No Hope, No Problem:

![[../../../../03_Reference/Pictures/perseipolis.png]]

Zero-hour contracts. Algorithmic bosses. Unaffordable housing. Welcome to the expendable generation \- where stability is a luxury and young people work harder for less, with no voice in the systems that exploit them.

Young people in the UK face unprecedented *precarity* \- the condition of living with uncertainty, instability, and vulnerability outside of their control. The cost of living crisis fuelled by: stagnant wages, ballooning housing prices, and Brexit trade friction, has squeezed young workers. Research from Urban Studies and Resolution Foundation indicates: "Young people are half as likely to own homes as their parents" (Acharya and Broome, 2024, p.3) and "The implication for younger people can be the choice between homeownership and deciding to have children." (Wetzstein, 2017, p.3160).

This *precarity* has a profound effect much beyond houses, it's contributing to rising anxiety, hopelessness, and disconnection. The Resolution Foundation has noted: "the number of NEETs (Not in Employment, Education, or Training) has risen by more than a quarter (up by 26 per cent, or 195,000) over the past two years to reach 940,000 in 2024-25" (Diniz and Murphy, 2025, p.9). The explosion in NEETs isn't a coincidence. Rising uncertainty and instability can deeply wound those who may already be vulnerable, more young people feel as if they cannot build or work towards a future \- so why continue to try? This expresses that *precarity* is extremely damaging not only financially, but psychologically and emotionally.

In essence, *precarity* is breaking young people; financially and spiritually.

This shows no signs of changing, as government forces pushed back against a bill to ban 0-hour contracts. The House of Lords continues to strike back against the Employment Rights Bill (Moss, 2025), which would seek to improve the working conditions of many young people across the UK. There are people in the House of Commons who do want to help the young people, yet there are those in the Lords who are elite, unaccountable and who actively sow the seeds of *precarity*.

When traditional institutions consistently fail people facing such precarity, they stop trusting them. They start looking for alternatives. And increasingly, those alternatives come in the form of *populist* movements.

*Populist* movements are characterised by a rhetoric of the virtuous, ordinary people against the corrupt and self-interested elite. These movements are frequently spearheaded by *charismatic leaders* who act as the "voice of the people" and rally support through inspiring others, promising change and acting as pillar of stability through danger \- someone who can get the job done.

However, this comes fraught with many dangers. Charismatic leaders can end up abusing their power \- to re-write the rules to suit themselves, they can perpetuate harm by scapegoating people and promising ineffective simple solutions to complex problems. They can end up perpetuating the same problems, or even damaging systems even more depending on the whims of the individual. Reform UK is capitalising on this, with recent polling showing the party has become the most popular among Gen Z men (Penna, 2025).

Yet *populism* rarely delivers on its promises. Right-wing populist movements identify genuine problems \- precarity, institutional failure, economic insecurity \- but offer scapegoats rather than solutions. Young people are encouraged to blame immigration and diversity policies for their economic struggles (Nilan, 2025), while the structural causes remain untouched. Reform MPs, despite their anti-establishment rhetoric, voted against banning zero-hour contracts \- protecting the very precarity that fuels their support base (Hope Not Hate, 2025). This is performative *populism*: exploiting genuine grievances while maintaining elite connections and business interests.

Hannah Brise offers a different answer, a 24-year-old member of the South of Scotland Enterprise Youth Advisory Forum (SOSE YAF), represents young people navigating this tension. She's experienced the lack of voice at decision-making tables. Yet rather than turning to populist strongmen, she chose organizing herself.

The SOSE YAF, was founded 2023, to enable young people to shape their region through sharing their experience, views, and feedback. It connects young people with policymakers and investors, giving a voice to the future. Hannah asserts that: "If it wasn't for the forum, I don't think I would have been able to apply to uni for community development and education.". Over their first 2 years, SOSE continues to work to boost prospects in the Scottish borders for young entrepreneurs through their pathways program.

Young people don't need a charismatic leader promising easy answers. They need to organize collectively, demand systemic change, and refuse to be divided by the precarity that populists exploit. The solution isn't waiting for salvation \- it's building power together from the ground up.

My call to action: Join or create youth councils like the SOSE YAF. Form tenant unions to fight housing exploitation. Support worker cooperatives as alternatives to gig economy precarity. Vote out the Lords blocking employment rights. Challenge the elites through democratic organizing, not by following strongmen who will betray you. Demand better conditions not just for yourself, but for the next generation \- because collective power is the only real answer to collective precarity.

## **My Leadership Figure and Interview Plan:**

I'm interviewing Hannah Brise, a board member of the South of Scotland Enterprise Youth Advisory Forum (SOSE YAF). Hannah is a young person from Newton Stewart who navigated significant challenges including struggling with confidence to apply for university and limited opportunities. Through YAF involvement, she developed as a leader and advocated for other young people, representing adaptive leadership that builds collective power from the bottom up rather than top-down authority.

I'm using public information from SOSE reports, videos, and their website. I was applying for the SOSE YAF board myself, and her interview resonated with me, making her ideal for this assignment.

I chose Hannah because she's experiencing the precarity-populism tension firsthand. Economic prospects in the South of Scotland are poor \- this is why YAF and SOSE exist as governmental programs to improve the region. She's rejected divisive rhetoric to build herself and others up, embodying adaptive leadership. I'll gain lived knowledge and perspective organically.

**Expected insights beyond public data:**

1. **Understanding how precarity is lived**: Moving beyond statistics to grasp how economic insecurity affects young people's daily psychological state, sense of future, and willingness to engage with institutions. A structured interview will reveal mechanisms linking material conditions to political attitudes.  
2. **Exploring populist vulnerability**: Investigating whether economic hardship genuinely exposes young people to populist ideas, or whether community, opportunities, and genuine voice provide resilience against divisive rhetoric. Hannah's choice to organize rather than radicalize offers critical insight.  
3. **Distinguishing democratic organizing from populism**: Discovering practical differences between youth forums like SOSE YAF and populist movements—both challenge existing structures through fundamentally different approaches. Understanding why democratic participation feels worthwhile when systems appear captured will illuminate whether youth-led organizations offer a viable alternative to both apathy and destructive politics.

## Two Block 1 Concepts:

**Precarity**: Economic and social instability affecting young people—unaffordable housing, zero-hour contracts, student debt, and pervasive uncertainty about the future. Precarity erodes hope and trust in traditional institutions.

**Populism**: Political movements framing society as "virtuous people versus corrupt elite," often led by charismatic figures promising radical change. While identifying genuine grievances, populism offers scapegoats rather than systemic solutions.

## **Questions:**

1. Researchers talk about young people facing a 'perfect storm' \- unaffordable housing, zero-hour contracts, student debt. How do you see these issues playing out among people our age?

2. When you're working unstable jobs, can't afford a home, and don't know what next month looks like \- how does that affect your ability to believe in a stable future?

3. Traditional politicians often promise to help young people, but conditions don't improve. Do you think young people still trust that mainstream parties are working for them?

4. Some people describe the current system as 'the elite' protecting their own interests while ordinary people struggle. Does that framing resonate with your experience?

5. When people feel ignored by traditional politics, they're attracted to leaders who promise to 'shake up the system.' Why does that message appeal to young people facing precarity?

6. Populist movements frame politics as 'virtuous people versus corrupt elite.' When you're struggling while seeing wealthy people get richer, does that narrative feel true?

7. Some researchers say precarity makes people more vulnerable to populist rhetoric. Do you think economic insecurity makes people willing to take risks on radical political solutions?

8. The Youth Advisory Forum seems like a different response \- grassroots, collective, building power from the ground up. How is that different from following a populist leader who promises to fix everything?

9. You said the Forum gave you 'a voice on a table it wouldn't normally be on' \- that sounds like challenging the establishment, which populists also claim to do. What's the difference between healthy democratic participation and destructive populism?

10. Do you think the answer to precarity is waiting for the right leader to save us, or young people organizing themselves to demand systemic change from the bottom up?

## **Critical Reflection:**

**Formulating my argument**, I remembered tutorial advice: "Pick something you genuinely care about, and you'll make a higher quality piece." I reflected on what matters to me: I feel as if young people are struggling, becoming isolated, and becoming more radical.

**Gathering information** was challenging. Reading and analysing reports was draining \- especially denser reports by the Resolution Foundation. A breakthrough was around how the House of Lords slows changes that would help young people through the Employment Rights Bill \- It felt as if I found verifiable evidence of elites protecting precarity transformed my research from purely academic into something more urgent and meaningful.

**Applying information** came naturally once I had concrete evidence. I could make points and build a narrative whilst supporting it with evidence in a punchy, interesting way. There's nothing I dislike more than boring text \- even if it holds gold, it drills into your mind, sapping away the joy.

**Considering implications**, I realised what I'm doing isn't much different from the populist leaders I flag as dangerous. Am I just presenting claims in a sleek, simple way like a charismatic leader would? 

I wrestled with this, concluding I'm trying to raise awareness for the cause. You've always got to be aware to use knowledge and skill for the greater good, rather than personal gain. It cemented my idea that studying to gain knowledge is more important than just gaining marks. The marks will come if the skill is there.

**Exploring other viewpoints**, I realised through my research that people and leaders within the House of Commons or SOSE do want to help young people—they see them as the future of the nation or cities they live in. This challenged my viewpoint that the whole system is against young people. It isn't—there are a mix of positive and negative factors. It isn't all doom and gloom.
