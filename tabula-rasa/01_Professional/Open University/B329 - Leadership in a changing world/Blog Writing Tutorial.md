# Blog Writing Tutorial:

Conversational style, not too academic. Have references and a coherent style.

1. Title that captures interest
2. Content Tailored to particular audience
	1. Pick your audience before your topic.
3. Use of images
4. Introduction which grabs the reader
5. Logical structure - Inverted Pyramid
6. Call to action
	1. Near the end, and make is obviously clear. You can even use the words call to action.
	2. It should stand out and be obvious what should be done next.
	3. The call to action should refer to a social challenge/social issue. Should fire people up right away.
	4. In the tail.
7. Succinct and persuasive writing
8. Subheading to lead the reader.

When you have a clear audience you have content which addresses their own concerns, that addresses their pain points and provides solutions for them.

You could talk to:
- HR managers
- Volunteer sector managers
- Early career workers
- general public
- Citizens of a given place, etc.

Be provocative, short and snappy title. (e.g. The Monarchy is finished)
State who your audience is within your writing.

### Choosing a Unique Topic:

Content is only as good as the topic chosen. Pick a topic that interests you as well as the audience.

Make sure it's something that you actually care about or something you know enough about to communicate well to come across as authentic and credible with readers. (e.g. Finance, Tariffs and trade rules).

Has to be up to date with recent news, talking about Tariffs or International trade would be good.

### Powerful Headline

Craft a headline that readers must click on. No more than 10 words, don't give a solution in your headline. Must be from at least 2025.

How Global Tariffs Are Squeezing UK Households. 

Ensure image is close to title.

## Inverted Pyramid Model:

Each piece of content should reinforce each other.

- The lead should introduce your argument, have a bang question.
- More explicit you are to the audience the more marks you can make it.
- 

## Example Blog:

![[../../../03_Reference/Pictures/Example-blog.png]]
- Needs concepts mentioned.
- References.
- Mention the interview in the blog.
	- Within the body of the post - make reference to your publicly available interviewee.

## Fit in with Relevant Module Concepts:

Write about two module concepts that you mention in *italics* at anytime in the processes. Define adaptive leadership or precarity, populism, charismatic leadership, or any other terms. Create a reference for these definitions.

Balance your word count on the two concepts together.

## Planned Interview:

The more you connect your blog, interview, and concepts together the better you'll do.

1. Who and why?
	1. Someone who is public available.
2. Concepts
	1. Define the concepts to the other person as well.
3. Compelling Narrative
	1. Questions need to be developmental.

It's a planned interview and doesn't need to be conducted. 2-3 questions not enough, 10-20 could be about right. Around 5+ could be fine if strong questions.

Talk about what you expect to learn from the interview.

## Module Concepts:

- Lack of confidence in political figures
- Data breaches
- Economic management from governments and businesses
- Economic instability.
- AI into business
- NHS struggling
- Precarity and migration
	- The home office
	- Devolved Governments.
- Mental health crisis
- Public inquiry
- Public exhaustion
- Multi-cultural society little values.

- 50% of marks are most of your marks, only use module material.
- Integrate the interview - following and interview with x - blah blah blah.
- Give something tangible in your call to action.

## Self-reflection:

**Start doing:** What things could help. What I want people to do.
**Stop doing:** What things aren't helping. What I don't want people to do.
**Continue doing:** What things are already helping. What I want people to keep doing.

Pray on consciousness. Convince people to change their behaviour.

Strong Call to action:

‘Every opinion matters! Let’s all sign a petition to stop businesses destroying the planet through their use of plastic packaging, before the wildlife you once enjoyed is no longer a peaceful place to relax!’?
