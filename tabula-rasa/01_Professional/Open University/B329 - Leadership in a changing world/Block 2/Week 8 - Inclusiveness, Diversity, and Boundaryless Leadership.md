# Introduction:

A key challenge of leaders is that you're often working with people who have a diverse set of characteristics, ideals, personalities, etc. 

Leaders can run into problems with resistance, people make poor decisions, reject influence, oppose change, and struggle working with others.
## Key Themes:
- Implementing [[../Glossary#^Inclusiveness-def|Inclusiveness]] and [[../Glossary#^Diversity-def|Diversity]] in leadership.
- Navigating the challenges of [[../Glossary#^BL-def|Boundaryless Leadership]].
- Applying situational leadership styles for different contexts.
- Exploring alternative approaches to transcend traditional boundaries.

***
# 1. Exploring Inclusion and Diversity:

We have difference between members in a group - these can be visible or invisible traits. 

[Michalle E. Mor Barak (2017)]((<https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Managing_Diversity.html?id=hFG0DAAAQBAJ&redir_esc=y>) denotes that diversity can be any dimension of differencing groups or individuals, that we should view these traits positively and empower people by respecting their unique ideas, expertise, experiences, and backgrounds.

Teams run into the problem of not using diversity, because humans select naturally for teammates based on **similarity** and **proximity** rather than differences.

Naturally, humans fight against this, so we need to figure out how to leverage diverse thought and opinions strategically.

## Activity 1 - Looking beyond the Dots:

### 1. Are the Dots There?

We look at dots and try to complete the line activity then the Hermann grid, this optical illusion tricks us into seeing something that isn't really there, but we can see the outline of a shape.

The idea being, that our first impress of people are not always true and that we can project characteristics onto other people. 

### 2. Have You Created or Viewed Someone Poorly from a First Impression?

Yes, I had a lecturer at university who was a women, came dressed up in a Zelda T-shirt, and was fat. Her first lecture and tutorial we had, she rambled on and seemed nervous, unsure, and said lots of words, but didn't speak concisely.

This caused me to a low opinion of her to begin with, but my friend group also did as well, which enhanced the perception as well. 

This first impression make working difficult with her in the future, as I kept seeing the same person from day 1 through our follow up activities, she was actually very solid at online and async communication, replying faster than most of my other lecturers - but I ended up not leveraging the diversity in this sense.

The problem being, that she WAS incompetent and ended up being fired. I initially thought - "That people like her shouldn't be teachers or are useless.", but after realising the extent on the incompetence at my previous university the reality is more like "The university was on fire behind the scenes, and she was a symptom of a larger problem."

The thing is this resulted in an institutional bias towards academic and educational systems. If I see anything poor happening with the OU or institutions, I believe that they are incompetent and useless. My trust is much lower now.
## 1.1. Inclusiveness:

Inclusiveness is a term that is applied to the practice of making the most of diverse staff and people. High levels of inclusiveness fosters a depth and range of behaviours which can be used to respond to the needs of turbulence and precarity.

An inclusive workplace, would be one which accepts and uses diversity within its workforce.
### Activity 2 - Exploring Inclusiveness in Leadership:

Inclusion challenges vary by context and locations, in the US race and gender dominate frequently. Tech companies also face additional barriers, such as hierarchies between technical staff and other functions (markets, HR, finance, sales) that limit how an organisation can function.

**Example:** Technical staff can dominate discussions beyond their expertise - weighing in on marketing, sales, and other areas where they are less effective. This happens in environments where technical contributions/credibility are valued above anything else.

 **When a group values a certain traits or ideals above all else, they can ignore other features that enable growth/success.** We can classify an approach that rejects this as: [[../Glossary#^GI-def|Global Inclusion.]]

Two practical strategies are:
1. **Anonymous code names for ideas** - Removing names and backgrounds to suggested ideas, leading to better uptake from ideas from those who are underrepresented.
2. **Audit your go-to network** - Identify who you routinely consult, assess its limitations and expand your network to include different perspectives.

Inviting the unexpected, challenge assumptions and seek new information or sources beyond your default circle.

[Michalle E. Mor Barak (2017)]((<https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Managing_Diversity.html?id=hFG0DAAAQBAJ&redir_esc=y>) also defines an inclusive workspace as the following:
- **Values and utilises the differences of the individual and groups**. Ultimately, it will aim to modify organisational values and norms to accommodate its employees.
- **Works with the surrounding community and contributes to the community**. The organisation acknowledges that it does not have responsibility only to its stakeholders but to the wider society.
- **Works with individuals, groups and organisations from a variety of national and cultural backgrounds**. The organisation seeks to develop international collaborations so as to expand further the possibility for diversity.
- **Seeks ways to support disadvantaged groups**. The organisation will seek to hire and train people who are perceived as belonging to disadvantaged groups.

Barak asserts the value of external inclusion, how organisations not only focus internally, but how they interact with external forces such as people and the community. That practices and methods should be accepted that treat groups equally across an organisation and community.
### 1.1.1. Applying Inclusive Practices:

[Choi et all (2021)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10902-016-9801-6) explains how the actions of leaders significantly impact team members sense of belonging and uniqueness. The core idea is making people feel competent and well-suited to their job or work, inclusive behaviour enhances this.

### Activity 3 - Harnessing Diversity:

In accordance to [Groysberg and Connolly (2013).](https://research-ebsco-com.libezproxy.open.ac.uk/c/zctsoi/search/details/hsrumjesyv?db=bth) 
#### 1. Why Should Diversity Be a Strategic Priority?

There are two main reasons why diversity should be a strategic priority.

1. **Business Imperative** - CEOs (Paul Block, Jonathan Broomberg) view diversity as essential for a competitive advantage, citing increased learning and growth internally, creating dissent required for innovation and breakthroughs, and creativity.
2. **Moral Imperative** - CEOs commitment to diversity also occurs because of discrimination that they've received. Ajay Banga, a Sikh in America experienced discrimination after 9/11. Carlos Ghosn's passion and drive was derived from his mum being denied education because of gender. 

These experiences created self-awareness and empathy within these CEOs to design systems that wouldn't cause discrimination again
#### 2. The Eight Organisational Practices to Enhance Diversity:

1. **Measure Diversity and Inclusion** - Having clear metrics drives accountability of diversity, by having data better decisions can be made and issues can be diagnosed.
2. **Hold Managers Accountable** - Making diversity a key goal for performance objectives encourages people to pursue them.
3. **Support Flexible Work Arrangements** - Supporting employees balance professional and personal commitments
4. **Recruit and Promote from Diverse Pools** - Track your candidate pool and hiring and retention.
5. **Provide Leadership Education** - Invest in leadership for employees at a lower level.
6. **Sponsor Employee Resource Groups and Mentoring Programs** - Create networks of sharing affiliations to provide development opportunities.
7. **Offer Quality Role Models** - Having diverse leaders builds the impression of: "If they can, I can".
8. **Make the Chief Diversity Officer (CDO) Position Count.** - Give authority and executive support to enact change
#### 3. If You Had to Complete a Task and Build an Inclusive Culture, what Would You Do and what Challenges Would You Face?

I would first conduct an honest and objective analysis of where my group/team stands at with diversity or inclusion at the current moment in time. So that accurate data can be gathered and what aspect of diversity should be focused on first.

Something I would do first for employees would be to honour flexible work arrangements and commitments, this is not only something I believe produces higher quality work - it supports a diverse group of people (pregnant women, neurodivergent individuals, disabilities) by giving them an environment that better suits their needs, rather than a blanket one size fits all approach. This flexibility something I would appreciate myself, I would want to give that back to employees/team members/peers. When doing so, I'd assert the importance of diversity and flexibility, that we support our team members in succeeding in their own way.

During these processes I would remain empathetical, respectful, and understanding. Whilst trying to present the key themes and ideas within diversity to different groups. To be involved within diversity programs and practices to set a positive example.

The challenges that are likely to be faced are that of unconscious bias, resistance and managing flexibility and support whilst achieving business goals as well.

# 2. Leadership Styles:

Leaders can have dominant styles that they naturally fit into, or can adapt their style to suit the needs of the team, just like how a car has different gears. There are many different approaches to leadership. 

[Blanchard et all (1985)](https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Leadership_and_the_One_Minute_Manager.html?id=geebCcCyLI8C&redir_esc=y), suggests that leaders need to adapt their style to different situations, different levels of staff experiences and characteristics. This is called [[../Glossary#^SI-def|Situational Leadership.]]

![[../../../../03_Reference/Pictures/Pasted image 20260109153958.png]]

### 2.0.1. Situational Leadership Model:

According to this model, the leader adapts to the working environment and the needs of a particular community/organisation/team they are leading. Therefore, the leader is monitoring and modifying their style and approach to the changing needs of the group.

Moving between the four styles are as followed:
1. **Directing style.** In this style, the leader gives an explicit briefing for a task and monitors subsequent performance closely. This style usually aligns with individuals who are new to a task or lack the specific skills required.
2. **Coaching style.** In this style, the leader briefs the team members on what is required but also seeks their opinions. This style usually aligns with individuals who are able to perform a task but are not willing to do so.
3. **Supporting style.** In this style, the leader facilitates, encourages and supports team members’ judgements and provides advice. This style usually aligns with individuals who have the skills to perform a task but lack confidence or try to avoid responsibilities.
4. **Delegating style.** In this style, the leader hands over complete discretion for a task so that team members manage it and make decisions themselves. This style usually aligns with individuals who have experience and the necessary skills to perform a task while also seeking responsibility.

My leadership style is mainly **supporting** and **coaching**, whilst having harder times **delegating** and **directing**.
![[../../../../03_Reference/Pictures/Pasted image 20260109154915.png]]

I got a 17/24 - meaning my effectiveness as a leader is good, but I need to trust myself more and have more confidence in leading, not being afraid of showing that I'm a leader.
## 2.1. Adapting Your Leadership Style:

### Activity 5 - Adapting and Improving Your Leadership Style:

#### 1. What is Your Favourite Leadership Style, what is Least Favourite?:

As a leader, I generally like to treat people who I'm working with in a similar way to how I want to be treated, with support and aid - rather than strict direction. But this isn't a fool proof approach, since everyone has different perspectives, strengths, and weaknesses. This means I move towards the **support** and **coaching** direction.

Perhaps a person needs a bit more direction, or a push. Maybe another needs confidence. Finally a person may be solid to be left alone. It's more challenging for me to have the confidence to tell someone what to do, as I like to respect autonomy where I can. Meaning the **directing** process is against me.
#### 2. What Changes Do You Need to Make to Be More Flexible as a Leader?

Starting off you've got to understand that the directing traits and delegating traits are within me as a person. Even if they aren't it's a learnable skill or technique being more firm in that way, the first step is recognising that you aren't stuck in a specific personality or way of being, just because you lean that way naturally.

Practically speaking, this would mean being more assertive in low-stakes scenarios and building up your confidence and capacity slowly. Then repeating and practicing that kind of behaviour until you get hang of it, understanding that you will make mistakes in this learning process and not beating yourself is also critical.

#### 3. How Would I Increase My Score?

I would practice translating my coaching/supporting nature into a more assertive delegation/directive behaviour. I can rationalise that I'm still upholding my beliefs and ideas by saying that different people need different styles to flourish and develop. Think of it as giving some tough love to a child, they may get upset but you're doing it to help them, not out of malice.

***
# 3. Boundaryless Leadership:

Populism is very relevant to leadership as a whole, where the will of the people is pitted against the powerful elite. Populist leaders present themselves as the voice of the people who are here to fix the situation and fight the elite. These leaders are often **charismatic leaders.**

An [[../Glossary#^Inspiring-Leadership-def|Inspiring Leader]] can act with positivity, flexibility, fairness, and openness can bring people together and lead beyond prescribed boundaries. [[../Glossary#^BL-def|Boundaryless leadership]] is less about formal authority and hierarchy, whilst more about insight, personal accountability, connection to values, and action.

Boundaryless leadership means that a leader is able to bring together a diverse group of people and adapt their leadership style to suit the needs of the situations, individuals, cultures, and environments.

Work is no longer confined to traditional boundaries (Career ladder gone, technology moving fast, gig work, job hopping, etc) , as such, leaders must be able to adapt to mobiles diverse teams effectively. It signifies that a leader is flexible, open, willing to try – and maybe fail – trusts, listens to and empowers others. 
## Activity 6 - Enabling Boundaryless Leadership:

### 1. The Value of Leaders that Bring People Together:

Leaders that bring people together fulfil a myriad of solutions - They solve problems within social, societal, personal, and corporate problems. People can be divided or fractured for whatever reasons, leaders bring them together - even under situations like precarity, populist rhetoric, and turbulence.

In essence without elements of connection, people and actors within a system act more defensively which stifles innovation, and allows systematic problems to compound. 

e.g. The silo effect: Where an actor or group withhold information to protect themselves. 

A lack of connection also decreases clarity and vision of actors - cybersecurity requires that actors all participate in security - not just a technical team; it needs staff, leadership, and shared responsibility. If people say "Not my job" or dismiss security claims, this is when breaches happen.

### 2. How Can Leaders Bring People Together?

1. **Listening as a foundational practice** - Listen and include people, hear the voices of what is going on before making decisions.
2. **Respecting differences** - Respect different points of views and perspective, you want to grab the big picture, not be stuck in your own mindset or vision. Even hash claims, that you disagree with, from someone you personally dislike. Is still useful.
3. **Addressing real concerns** - Requires listening and including diverse opinions and perspectives, if you only listen to one party, you miss all the others who are operating.
4. **Integration, not domination** - Staff members want their interests to be integrated with business strategy. Translate varying needs into a unified goal, don't force conformity but synthesis.

### 3. How Important is Inclusiveness and Diversity in Bringing People Together and Three Methods of Dealing with Incivility:

The three methods are:
1) Business strategies that produce returns and good jobs.
	1) A company that invests in workers rather than treating them as costs to minimise increases productivity.
	2) This requires workers and employers to work reciprocally. Workers perform so that they get invested in. The employer gains labour/productivity to invest into the company.
2) Rebuild workers to allow bargaining power.
	1) People when working want some level of voice, agency, impact over their working conditions.
	2) This should be done cooperatively, you advocate towards collective problems rather than your own interests.
3) Ensure stakeholders are all working together.
	1) Businesses, Governments, Educators, Workers need to be on the same page to reach a common goal.
	2) If one side breaks the agreement, then it falls to pieces.

*In essence, this framework only applies when workers aren't fungible and can be replaced easily. Both an employer and employee can often stay in a relationship of mutual extraction, where positive change requires taking on risk.*

Really it's the tension between reality and idealism. Certain models work in certain places but not all of them. Reading the room is critical - both socially and in organisations.

***
# 4. Global Leadership Competencies:

Global leadership requires five fundamentals competencies that drive global decision making within leadership:

- **Driving outcomes** – Leading across functions, representing the company internationally, championing high-potential talent regardless of origin
- **Decision making** – Knowing when to adapt locally versus introduce change, balancing learning with teaching
- **Results orientation** – Building relationships and cultural partnerships rather than focusing solely on tasks
- **Inspiring others** – Adapting communication and leadership styles to fit different contexts
- **Executing strategy** – Drawing out diverse perspectives and bridging different views for optimal solutions

These tie into broader themes of diversity, inclusion, and multicultural leadership. You've got to understand cultural assumptions of various backgrounds that people take for granted and use these to build a better workplace.

| Leadership Competency                                                                               | Additional Global Considerations                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Driving outcomes:** *Delegating; Influence and negotiation; Developing direct reports and others* | Exercises leadership across multiple functions to accomplish objectives; serves as corporate 'ambassador', or the face of the company; finds solutions when local resources are limited. Identifies and champions high-potential individuals, regardless of country of origin, who can provide the future impetus to growth in key global markets. |
| **Decision making:** *Seasoned judgment; Conflict management*                                       | Knows when to adapt to local practices and when to assert a different perspective as a constructive change agent, when to learn and when to teach.                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| **Results orientation**                                                                             | Leads through relationships rather than immediate task focus when necessary; cognisant of dependency on others to get things done in a foreign setting, and able to build ties with a cultural guide when needed.                                                                                                                                  |
| **Inspiring others:** *Managing vision and purpose*                                                 | Able to shift communication style, leadership methods and strategy to fit different contexts; can move skilfully back and forth between different business environments, even when they call for very different approaches.                                                                                                                        |
| **Executing strategy:** *Strategic agility*                                                         | Leads in development of unique solutions by articulating own expectations, drawing out perspectives of important participants not normally included in decision making, 'bridging' different views to create best solution for organisation and its customers.                                                                                     |
This approach from Gundling et al. (2015) and is the core of boundaryless leadership and how it influences diversity and inclusion

## Activity 7 - Practical Examples on Boundaryless Leadership:

### 1. How to Create a Collaborative Environment?

There are a few key steps that I would take:

**Listen first, move second.** I would work on identifying the tacit and also illicit ideas and decisions that are being made within the group or current structure. Before imposing my ideas on the group too early. This should be done gently and with some icebreaking to build up rapport and good will within the group too.

By both listening and integrating to the groups needs, you can formulate the best move going forward.

**Translate varying needs into unified goals, rather than forcing a one-size-fits-all approach.** You need to synthesis the ideas/cultures/expectations/styles of others into solutions that work for them, perhaps one team/sub-group requires more autonomy, another team needs direction and coaching, etc.

The important trap here is that you can project what you want onto the group and assume what they want, hence the listening step first as being mission critical. Elements of personal ego or external pressures to get things done quickly could also motivate decisive, yet ineffective action. Intellectual honesty of what you do and don't clearly understand is key.

**Model flexibility in the process.** For me personally, I struggle with being more directive and delegating to others, if I show and model that I'm able to work and shift to collaborate and suit the needs of the work. Others will be more likely to follow.

### 2. What Leadership Skills Do You have/lack? Which Are the Most Important?

My main skill is that I have a supportive style, that encourages autonomy and thinking for yourself. Which aligns with how I'd want to be treated. That this is achieved through building people up and letting them work for themselves, rather than being overbearing.

The ideal here is to get into a position where the team itself becomes a self-directed unit, where it works at maximum ability with minimal friction.

My main weakness is directing style of leadership. In certain situations a more heavy handed approach is necessary. More assertion, confidence and voice to tell people what has to be done, sometimes you need to push back other teams you need to yield, but recognising that can be tough, since I'm more inclined to yield.

I would find it harder to do something that would hurt a person right now, but would help them long term.

### 3. Do You Consider Yourself to Have the Skills for Boundaryless Leadership?

Partially, but I have some clear areas to develop upon.

Understanding context and making people feel heard and understood is a key part of boundaryless leadership. Diverse groups of people will become more empowered and have a greater sense of unity. Which will enhance business outcomes, team performance, and staff satisfaction over time.

To develop further, I would need to deliberately practice direction and delegating modes within low-stakes situations, to build up my skill and pattern recognition - you can think of it like playing hands of poker - each social interaction is a hand with certain cards, I know what to do given the cards and board, but actually executing that with money, pressure, emotions on the line is where I'd need to grow.

# 5. Block Case Study:

**THIS RELATES TO THE TMA 01!**


> [!ABSTRACT] Case Study - Susan 1:
> 
>It is becoming more common for companies to advertise their commitment to diversity and inclusion by publishing their diversity aims and relevant data supporting their achievements in this area. Some companies do so because of real commitment to increase diversity and inclusion in their organisation, while others may advertise information about their diversity strategy in order to boost their profits.
>
>The head office of Susan’s bank has asked her to share the profile of her team so that the company can produce a report indicating the company’s diversity status. Some people feel Susan’s team is quite diverse. Susan has a good relationship with them. In discussions with the bank’s staff, she has heard rumours that a member of her team who has a learning disability, and another member who is Muslim, do not want to share this information with other staff members.

## What Should Susan Do?

> [!DANGER] Option A
> 
> There are two ways to look at this problem. For one thing, I’m duty-bound to honour head office’s request to share my team’s profile, and it’s clear that the bank needs this data to illustrate a positive image regarding diversity and inclusiveness. 
> 
> For another, it’s an opportunity for my team to celebrate their diversity. None of my staff has ever explicitly told me that they don’t want to share this information, and they’ve never tried to hide their differences. Leading such a diverse team is not an easy task, and this is an opportunity to show to head office that I can direct individuals with different expertise, opinions and viewpoints.


>[!SUCCESS] Option B
>
>If I want to prove that I’m an effective leader who takes others’ points of view into account, I have to discuss the matter with my team first. After all, I already know that, even if they haven’t told me directly, some members aren’t happy about sharing their personal information. 
>
>They are afraid that even if the information is anonymised, their colleagues will be able to identify who they are when the report is published. I’ll get everyone together and explain the request to share their profiles in order to publish a diversity report, while explaining that the company need this information to build a positive image. 
>
>I’ll explain that diversity is about exploring our differences, taking different points of view and seeking ways to bring different perspectives together. This is the time to be a supportive leader. I will offer only my advice; it’s up to them to decide if they agree with me or not. I’ll support their judgment in any event.

> [!INFO] Option C
> 
> It’s very important in this case to think of what kind of leader I want to be and adapt my style to the particular situation. I understand why head office feel the need to share my team’s profile, but it doesn’t seem honest to claim that we as a company respect diversity just because my team is diverse. 
> 
> This is *not* what the bank should mean by celebrating diversity and inclusiveness. I don’t want to be the teacher here, but the best thing to do is to speak to head office and explain that, as a bank, we should change our diversity strategy and aims. 
> 
> I will try to convince them that, first of all, we need to attract diverse employees to improve the diversity profile of the company and then advertise our image as a diverse organisation.

# My Choice - Option B:

**Option A** is problematic because:
- It rationalizes overriding employee privacy concerns with "they never explicitly told me"
- It frames the decision primarily around Susan's own career visibility ("show head office I can direct...")
- It conflates *having* a diverse team with *celebrating* diversity — the former doesn't require consent, the latter does

**Option C** has good instincts about authenticity, but:
- It sidesteps the immediate problem rather than addressing it
- Telling head office to "change the diversity strategy" is presumptuous and unlikely to succeed
- It doesn't actually resolve what Susan should do *now* about the data request

***

**Option B** works because it builds goodwill and employee autonomy within the group. You need to first validate whether these rumours are true before acting on the decision to release a report.

By being transparent with the team, you can explain the rationale behind why a diversity report would help and create space for meaningful discussion. In this situation, you work to support the team — if this discussion is executed well, the team will feel supported and empowered, as you aren't willing to make decisions that head office wants that could potentially harm them without consideration.

Susan is then able to liaise with head office to share the team's decision or explain the situation for not sharing diversity details — asserting that it would undermine diversity and inclusion itself by making those who are diverse feel more vulnerable and less welcome within the workplace, the opposite of the goal of inclusion.

If head office pushes for this report and forces your hand, you can explain to the employees who are negatively affected that you were in discussions and tried to advocate for them.

However, there is a real danger here: if you have a meeting with staff and they feel or observe that you've already made your mind up or taken a side, then push the report through anyway, your actions will feel performative and disingenuous — creating a rift between Susan and her team.

Taking a supportive and non-judgemental approach is exactly what Option B describes and what will build the best outcome, hence my choice.

You could say this isn't even about a diversity report, but the power balance between employees and leaders. Where leaders are in positions where they can undermine or ignore concerns of those below them, in favour of those above them. Whereas employee's can't.

The trust is easy to break, as one bad call can make years of goodwill or faith seem like theatre, since the underlying power dynamic doesn't vanish.

# Summary:

This week covered three main areas:
1. **Problem-solving through adaptive leadership** – adjusting your style and drawing on different competencies depending on the situation. The module references Blanchard's four styles (coaching, supporting, directing, delegating) and Gundling's global leadership competencies around driving outcomes, decision-making, inspiring others, and executing strategy.

2. **Diversity and inclusion** – diversity refers to any dimension that differentiates people, while inclusion means actively leveraging those differences to expand an organisation's capabilities. Leaders who engage heterogeneous teams effectively can create competitive advantage.

3. **Boundaryless leadership** – the ability to unite diverse groups while adapting style, communication, and strategy across different cultures and contexts.

***

# Reflection and Sharing:

Boundaryless leadership demands more than conceptual flexibility, it requires practicing uncomfortable modes deliberately.

My default style is more supportive/coaching, while genuine, becomes a limitation when situations call for direction/delegation. The challenge reminds me of poker: knowing the optimal play is different from executing it with money on the table. You can understand theoretically that firmness sometimes *is* support, but actually asserting that under social pressure, emotions, and real stakes requires pattern recognition built through repetition. 

Developing leadership range means deliberately practicing directive approaches in low-stakes situations before they're needed, treating each interaction as a hand that builds capacity for when it matters.
