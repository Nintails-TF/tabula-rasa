# Introduction:

This week explores the idea that leadership can be thought of as an endeavour to achieve [[../Glossary#^PSG-def|positive-sum outcomes]]. This approach focuses on achieving something good for all through leadership rather than achieving something that benefits one individual, team, or organisation at the expense of another.

The session uses game theory as a metaphor for understanding leadership behaviours and their intended outcomes, then explores [[../Glossary#^CL-def|collaboration]] as a strategy focused on win/win outcomes.

## Key Themes:
- Understanding [[../Glossary#^PSG-def|positive-sum]], [[../Glossary#^NSG-def|negative-sum]], and [[../Glossary#^ZSG-def|zero-sum]] approaches to leadership.
- Exploring collaboration as a strategy for achieving positive-sum outcomes.
- Recognising challenges: costs of collaboration, opportunistic behaviour, competing aims.
- Developing [[../Glossary#^IL-def|Integrative Leadership]] and a [[../Glossary#^VoS-def|Vision of Success]] for the common good.

## Key Questions:
1. What are positive, negative, and zero-sum approaches to leadership?
2. In what ways is collaboration a leadership strategy that achieves positive-sum outcomes?
3. What are the limitations of a positive-sum approach to leadership?

# 1. Positive, Negative, and Zero-Sum Games:

Game theory derives from economics but has been applied to social life to propose that everyday social interactions can be thought of in terms of games. We all play various "games" — studying games, teaching games, political games, relationship games, industrial-relations games.

Analysing interactions through just one week shows that social life comprises:
- **Cooperative/collaborative games** — where you work with others
- **Competitive games** — where you seek to win
- **Games where no one benefits** — stalemate or mutual destruction

Game theorists divide social games into three categories:

|Game Type|Definition|Outcome|
|---|---|---|
|[[../Glossary#^PSG-def\|Positive-sum]]|Good outcomes for all — win/win that increases resources for all players|Everyone gains|
|[[../Glossary#^NSG-def\|Negative-sum]]|Survival games in fiercely competitive environments where total resources are decreasing — even the winner only just survives|Everyone loses, but some lose less|
|[[../Glossary#^ZSG-def\|Zero-sum]]|One wins at the expense of others — win/lose where resources remain constant but transfer from one party to another|Winner gains exactly what loser loses|

**Examples:**
**Positive-sum:** Ben spots an opportunity to tender for a new project. He calls contacts to propose a joint bid. The joint bid wins funding for all organisations.

**Negative-sum:** Josef leads contract negotiations for his small cleaning company. The overall contract value has reduced by 30%. He convinces the contract holder to award his company 70% (previously 50/50 with a competitor). Both have lost out, but Josef's organisation loses slightly less.

**Zero-sum:** Sadie's department has high ambitions. In annual budget negotiations, she argues only her department can achieve targets. She leaves with a promotion and higher budget. Fellow department heads lose out while acknowledging Sadie made a reasonable case.

### Activity 1 - What Kinds of Leadership Games Are Being Played Around You?

Sports and games provide metaphors for leadership strategies: teamwork, cooperation, competition, individualism, passing, holding back, supporting, encouraging, tricking.

**Questions to consider:**
- Which game or sport most resembles the leadership games in your organisation?
- Are those games mostly positive, negative, or zero-sum?
- Which game or sport does your own preferred leadership approach most resemble?

---

# 2. Leadership Narratives:

[[../Glossary#^LN-def|Leadership narratives]] are the stories people tell about their experience of leadership — how they make sense of leadership, justify their actions, and what difference they think leadership makes. These narratives are at times hopeful, at other times full of frustration, cynical, or simply sad.

### Activity 2 - Analysing Leadership Narratives:

The Centre for Voluntary Sector Leadership (CVSL) research (2017-18) conducted interviews exploring how voluntary sector leaders collaborate with others. Analysing these narratives reveals whether speakers present leadership in positive, negative, or zero-sum terms.

**Key insight:** The way people talk about leadership reveals their underlying assumptions about what leadership is for and what outcomes they expect. Leaders who adopt collaborative strategies can achieve [[../Glossary#^CA-def|collaborative advantage]] — developing something new they could not achieve alone (Huxham and Vangen, 2005).

[Tsai and Chi (2024)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1472811723001088) study how educational interventions can promote win-win collaboration, offering practical strategies for fostering collaborative skills.

# 3. Collaboration: A Positive-Sum Game?

As explored in Week 9, [[../Glossary#^CL-def|collaboration]] as a leadership strategy tends to be associated with achieving positive-sum outcomes. [Otteson (2023)](https://magazine.nd.edu/stories/the-power-of-positive-sum-thinking/) discusses how positive-sum thinking underpins honourable business practices where all parties can benefit.

**However:** Collaborations all too often fail to achieve their intended goals.

## 3.1. Why Collaborations Fail:

**Costs of collaboration:**
- Creating effective processes requires energy and resources from all partners
- Time spent collaborating diverts attention from core organisational activities
- Relationship maintenance requires ongoing investment

**Opportunistic behaviour:**
- Collaborating organisations may take knowledge and resources from partners
- Promoting their own interests rather than engaging in mutual exchange
- "Free-riding" on partners' contributions

**Competing aims:**
- Partners have different — sometimes contradictory — objectives
- External pressures (policy makers, funders) impose constraints
- Individual aims may conflict with organisational or collaborative aims

[Barringer and Harrison (2000)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/014920630002600302) studied inter-organisational relationships (joint ventures, networks, consortia, alliances) and found that "making business partnerships work is a fragile balance of competing forces." Studies from PricewaterhouseCoopers, KPMG, and other commentators set the **failure rate at around 50%**.

## 3.2. Potential Outcomes of Collaboration:

|Potential Benefits|Potential Losses|
|---|---|
|Knowledge gains|Loss of proprietary knowledge or trade secrets|
|Firm visibility and reputation|Organisational disruption|
|Acquisition of new skills|Reputational damage|
|Broadening of managers' networks|Breakdown of relationships|
|Increased market share/access to new markets|Loss of market position|
|Increased resources|Costs of the collaboration process|
|Speed to market|Attention diverted away from the organisation|

**Key question:** How can leadership increase the likelihood of good outcomes for all — positive-sum or win/win outcomes — from collaborative working?

## 3.3. Leadership for Win/Win Outcomes:

Win/win outcomes are hard to achieve even when leaders:
- Act from both the "spirit of collaboration" and "collaborative thuggery" (Huxham and Vangen, 2005)
- Build trust, develop personal relationships, create a common vision (Goman, 2011)
- Follow collaborative problem-solving and decision-making models (Chrislip, 2002)

Yet collaboration holds huge potential for delivering what individuals and organisations struggle to achieve alone.

[Chi and Chi (2024)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1472811723001088) explore how leaders from rival parties can achieve win-win outcomes through sequences of collaborative episodes, emphasising trust building and mutual learning in conflict resolution.

### Activity 3 - Achieving Win/Win Outcomes:


**Leadership practices that push outcomes toward win/win:**
- Building trust over time
- Creating shared vision
- Transparent communication
- Focusing on both relationships AND outcomes
- Developing shared plans of action
- Willingness to compromise
- Regular reassessment and adaptation

**Personal reflection from the module author:**

> "We bypassed the prescribed performance-management process, or at least moulded it to meet our own ends. We were able to do this because we had a history of working together, were able to speak honestly with one another and spent time building relationships... We drank lots of coffee together and got to know each other better over lunch while also developing a shared plan of action."

> "However, I remember many other occasions when, in spite of my best endeavours, working collaboratively meant negotiating around tricky relationships and being prepared for relationship breakdown in order to achieve the aims of my organisation — even if this was at a cost to our partners."

---

# 4. Competing Aims:

As Huxham and Vangen (2005) point out, collaboration strategies that appear to be common sense don't always work in practice. It's common sense to agree on shared aims before starting — but research indicates that collaborative projects often get stuck at the beginning because it's impossible for individuals and organisations to agree on shared aims.

**Why this happens:**

Collaborating individuals, teams, and organisations all have different aims — aims imposed by external factors and stakeholders including policy makers, contract holders, and funders. These multiple aims:

- Overlap at key points
- Are distinct from those of others
- Create a "tangled web" of aims at different levels: individual, team, organisation, collaboration

**The paradox:** Differences between collaborating partners create the potential for collaborative advantage, BUT those same differences can pull partners apart.

### Activity 4 - Aims at Different Levels (Pola and Sarah Case Study):

**Bluespace and Teamasia Collaboration:**

|Level|Bluespace (Sarah)|Teamasia (Pola)|
|---|---|---|
|**Individual aims**|Get out of here and get a new job. Need this project as evidence, even if it takes far longer than working hours.|Meet targets and achieve joint project because committed to providing service in Southeast Asia. BUT also leave work at reasonable time to care for family.|
|**Organisational aims**|Have a UK service consistently rated highly. Aim to extend that service to larger customer base.|Have a small service targeting Southeast Asian market on minimal resources. Aim to increase resources.|
|**Collaboration (shared) aims**|To offer a high-quality, well-resourced service to a diverse customer base.||

**Key observation:** Sarah and Pola's individual aims are in tension — Sarah wants to overwork to build her CV; Pola wants work-life balance. Their organisational aims are complementary but not identical. Only the collaboration aims appear fully shared.

---

# 5. Managing Aims for Positive-Sum Outcomes:

Huxham and Vangen (2005, pp. 123-4) identify a fundamental tension in managing competing aims:

**Option A — Full transparency from the start:**
- Bring everyone's aims into the open
- Clarify motivations
- Tie down agreement about joint purpose

**Option B — Minimum viable clarity:**
- Gain just enough clarity and agreement to allow joint action to commence
- Seek common ground and get started
- Achieve early successes to build trust

> "We have to write a statement of aims to justify our existence — my new job is to find a way of writing it so that none of the parties can disagree." — Manager, area regeneration partnership

**Trade-offs:**

|Approach|Advantage|Risk|
|---|---|---|
|Full transparency|Reduces later surprises|May never get started — collaborative inertia|
|Minimum viable clarity|Enables action and builds trust through early wins|Irreconcilable differences may arise later after effort invested|

**Key insight:** An important step in leading towards positive-sum outcomes is accepting that aims will not be entirely compatible and compromises will be necessary. The question is WHEN to address incompatibilities — upfront or as they emerge.

### Activity 5 - Strategies for Managing Aims:

When collaborative working tends towards inertia, strategies to keep people engaged include:
- Gentle persuasion
- Well-structured arguments
- A little manipulation
- Lots of encouragement
- Reminding people of the shared vision
- Celebrating small wins
- Addressing concerns directly

**Key insight:** Keeping everyone on board when the "buzz of collaboration" dissolves into discouragement requires different strategies than launching collaboration in the first place.

# 6. Achieving the Common Good:

[Crosby and Bryson (2005)](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Leadership+for+the+Common+Good%3A+Tackling+Public+Problems+in+a+Shared+Power+World%2C+2nd+Edition-p-9780787967536) address the challenge of leading collaborations through [[../Glossary#^IL-def|Integrative Leadership]] — also described as "leadership for the common good."

**The common good** goes beyond win/win outcomes:

> "It entails widely beneficial outcomes that are never preordained but are instead arrived at through mindful leadership and active followership; it yields widespread benefit at reasonable cost and taps people's deepest interest in their own well-being and that of others." — Crosby and Bryson (2005, p. 360)

**Key practices of integrative leadership:**
- Building strategic cross-boundary relationships
- Taking advantage of windows of opportunity in the environment
- Committing personal assets to achieve change
- Developing inclusive processes and structures
- Attending to outcomes and holding partners accountable

**Accountability for the common good (Crosby, 2017, citing Crosby and Bryson, 2012):**
- Identifying and seeking immediate, intermediate, and long-term outcomes
- Building an accountability system that tracks inputs, process, and outcomes — a results-management system built on strong relationships
- Demonstrating resilience in the face of setbacks and engaging in regular reassessments

**Two critical practices:**
1. **Framing and reframing the vision** — adapting the vision as circumstances change
2. **Staying attuned to a [[../Glossary#^VoS-def|vision of success]]** — maintaining focus on desired outcomes

## 6.1. Developing a Vision of Success:

A [[../Glossary#^VoS-def|vision of success]] is not simply a generalised idea that mobilises people early in the collaborative process — it's a detailed vision that develops over time, influencing and enabling practical decision making.

**Advantages of a vision of success (Crosby and Bryson, 2005, pp. 321-322):**
1. **Channels efforts while enabling improvisation** — A widely accepted vision records enough consensus on ends and means to direct participants while creating a framework for innovation.
2. **Conception precedes perception** — People must have a conception of what success looks like before they can actually see it. The vision generates the conception needed to discriminate between preferred and undesirable actions/outcomes.
3. **Affirms the future in the present** — Motivates adherents to live the vision now; they don't predict the future — they make it.
4. **Enables distributed action** — Allows people to work on behalf of aims without relying on direction from central decision makers.
5. **Takes on moral quality** — Defines the substance and extent of the "court of public opinion" within the community subscribing to the vision.
    

### Activity 6 - Visions of Success:

**Key statements about visions of success:**

|Statement|True/False|
|---|---|
|A vision of success allows for improvisation|True|
|A vision of success predicts the future|False — it helps people MAKE the future|
|A vision of success enables people to work without central direction|True|
|A vision of success has a moral quality|True|

# 7. Limitations of the Positive-Sum Approach to Leadership:

A positive-sum approach is attractive for both individuals and organisations:
- **For individuals:** Who wouldn't want to achieve something good for everyone?
- **For organisations:** Positions them as attractive partners while promoting their own aims

**However, reasonable objections exist:**
1. **Unreasonable expectations** — Placing the burden of achieving "good for all" on leaders may be unrealistic.
2. **Competitive reality** — We live in a world where businesses and public services are competitive. Many organisations struggle to survive in uncertain, volatile, precarious environments.
3. **First responsibility** — Others may argue that leaders' first responsibility is to focus on their own team/organisation's aims and outcomes.
    

**The tension:**

For scholars like Crosby and Bryson, uncertain and precarious circumstances are exactly when we MUST develop shared visions of success and extend efforts to achieve the common good.

For others, survival comes first — positive-sum aspirations are a luxury when your organisation is under threat.

**Key insight:** Leadership poses tensions and dilemmas not easily resolved. If they were, someone would have written the definitive leadership book long ago. The challenge is to keep asking: Are you playing a leadership game for positive, negative, or zero-sum outcomes?

# 8. Block Case Study:

**Case Study — Susan 6:**

Susan has taken on the role of non-executive director for the local hospital trust. She's asked to support the HR director in merging two teams caring for older people as community hospitals close. HR managers handle complex details (terms, conditions, rotas) while Susan supports managers and encourages teams to see the merger's potential.

Susan reads the HR report: The community hospital team is very unhappy about the move. Official complaints have already been lodged.

## What Should Susan Do?

> [!DANGER] Option A
> 
> This really isn't the responsibility of a non-executive director with a full-time job elsewhere and limited HR expertise. I'm happy to meet with HR and the teams on a single occasion to ensure they know what the board decided and explore what lies ahead. Ultimately, the only way to make this work is for everyone to get on with the inevitable, even though there will be unavoidable pain. I absolutely stand by the board's decision that this delivers better quality and more comprehensive services. I'll confirm this in the meeting.

> [!INFO] Option B
> 
> I'd better plunge in, read the proposals and HR report in detail, then offer to meet with both teams and HR. I can share experiences of encouraging teams to collaborate in my own organisation. The new joint team will be very experienced, so the board can be ambitious in our targets. This is the time to work out exactly what the combined teams' aims will be: agree on detailed performance measures for the merger period and clear outcomes delivering the board's financial targets. Then I'm confident the teams will step up and iron out differences as the merger progresses.

> [!SUCCESS] Option C
> 
> I'll ask if I can listen in on HR's next meeting with the two teams to understand the potential for a new vision for the future combined team. Then I'd support establishing an ongoing conversation between teams to develop that vision and share insights from my own experience. The joint team will be bigger and better, with wider range of skills and experience, so that vision should be ambitious and contribute to the board's agenda. But the new team will develop over time and have ambitions of its own, so we need to keep listening to what they think the integrated service could become. I genuinely believe much more is possible than the board or individual teams have yet realised.

## My Choice - Option C:

**Option A** is problematic because:
- It treats the merger as purely a compliance issue — "get on with the inevitable."
- It ignores the potential for collaborative advantage from bringing two experienced teams together.
- It frames the situation as zero-sum: the board wins (gets its decision implemented), staff lose (experience "unavoidable pain").
- Susan's expertise and perspective are wasted on a single confirmatory meeting.

**Option B** has merit but is flawed:
- It brings Susan's experience to bear and engages with the detail.
- However, it front-loads agreement on aims and performance measures — the approach Huxham and Vangen warn can cause collaborative inertia.
- It assumes "teams will step up" once targets are set, ignoring the relationship-building required.
- The focus on "board's financial targets" frames success narrowly rather than developing a shared vision.

**Option C** works because:
- It starts with listening rather than telling — understanding what's actually happening before intervening.
- It recognises the potential for a [[../Glossary#^VoS-def|vision of success]] that goes beyond the board's current conception.
- It creates ongoing conversation rather than one-off meetings — enabling trust-building and shared understanding to develop.
- It acknowledges that the new team "will have ambitions of its own" — genuine positive-sum thinking where the collaboration creates something new rather than just implementing board decisions.
- It applies the "minimum viable clarity" approach — getting started on common ground while remaining open to where the collaboration leads.

**Connection to the week's themes:**
Option C embodies [[../Glossary#^IL-def|integrative leadership]] — building cross-boundary relationships, developing inclusive processes, and working towards the common good rather than just organisational targets. It treats the merger as an opportunity for positive-sum outcomes rather than a zero-sum implementation of board decisions.

# Summary:

This week covered three main areas:

1. **Game theory as leadership metaphor** — Positive-sum (win/win), negative-sum (survival/everyone loses), and zero-sum (win/lose) games provide a framework for understanding leadership behaviours and intended outcomes.
2. **Collaboration for positive-sum outcomes** — Collaboration holds potential for achieving what partners cannot achieve alone, but around 50% of collaborations fail. Challenges include costs of collaboration, opportunistic behaviour, and competing aims at multiple levels.
3. **Integrative leadership and visions of success** — Achieving the "common good" requires developing and sustaining a vision of success that channels efforts while enabling improvisation, affirms the future in the present, and enables distributed action.
    

**Key points:**
- Positive, negative, and zero-sum approaches focus attention on outcomes and whether they're good for all or for the few.
- Collaboration is focused on achieving good outcomes for all partners, but this is not automatic. Leadership strategies include addressing competing aims and developing/sustaining a vision of success.
- A positive-sum approach may place unreasonable expectations on individuals and promote overly optimistic views of what can be achieved in competitive, uncertain, precarious environments.

# Reflection and Sharing:

The positive-sum framing is useful because it forces explicit attention to outcomes — not just "did we collaborate?" but "who benefited and who lost?" Too often, collaboration is treated as inherently good without examining whether it actually delivered value to all partners.

However, I'm sceptical of the implied normative claim that leaders SHOULD always pursue positive-sum outcomes. The module acknowledges this tension but perhaps doesn't fully confront it. In genuinely zero-sum situations (budget allocation, market share, competitive contracts), pursuing "win/win" may be naïve — your gain really is my loss.

The 50% failure rate for collaborations is striking. If half of all collaborative efforts fail, the question isn't just "how do we collaborate better?" but "when should we NOT collaborate?" The opportunity cost of failed collaboration (diverted attention, broken relationships, wasted resources) suggests that selective collaboration — choosing carefully when and with whom to collaborate — may be more important than collaborative skills.

The Pola/Sarah case study is revealing: even with shared goals at the collaboration level, individual aims (Sarah's career ambitions vs. Pola's work-life balance) create tension. This suggests that "alignment" is never complete — there's always a gap between what individuals want and what the collaboration needs. Managing that gap, rather than pretending it doesn't exist, seems more realistic than pursuing perfect alignment.

The vision of success concept is powerful but also potentially manipulative. "Framing and reframing the vision" can mean genuinely adapting to new circumstances — or it can mean moving the goalposts to claim success regardless of actual outcomes. The line between "resilience in the face of setbacks" and "rationalising failure" isn't always clear.
