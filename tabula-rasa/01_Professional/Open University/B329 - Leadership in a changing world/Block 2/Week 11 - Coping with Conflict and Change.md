# Introduction:

This week focuses on leadership strategies that adopt a [[../Glossary#^CC-def|constructive approach to conflict]] by enabling people with different perspectives and opinions to express those views and work together to find a way forward — and, at times, by being willing to challenge powerful interests including senior managers and governance boards.

Many people prefer to avoid conflict, but sometimes it is inevitable or even necessary. Sometimes personal or social wellbeing depends on the willingness of individuals to stand up and speak out — leadership involves stepping up to such challenges.

## Key Themes:

- Understanding what causes conflict in changing environments.
- Questioning whether leadership should always reduce conflict.
- Exploring strategies that encourage [[../Glossary#^CD-def|constructive outcomes]] from conflict.
- Developing [[../Glossary#^CD-def|Constructive Dissent]] as a leadership practice.

## Key Questions:

1. What causes conflict in changing environments?
2. Is the task of leadership always to reduce conflict?
3. How do leadership practices and strategies encourage constructive outcomes from conflict?

# 1. Change, Leadership and Conflict:

Block 1 established that we live in a context of continual change — 21st-century society is characterised by turbulence and uncertainty where it is hard to predict what lies ahead. Uncertainty and precarity tend to reinforce the competing interests of different sections of society.

**Block 2 so far has shown:**
- Leading in turbulent environments requires bringing forward different identities ([[../Glossary#^SI-def|Situational Leadership]])
- Collaboration can move towards "thuggery" or the "spirit of collaboration" (Vangen and Huxham, 2003)
- [[../Glossary#^RL-def|Relational leadership]] accounts for how people with and without positions influence one another

**The broader context:**
Changes in society over the last 40 years have contributed to increasing inequality of wealth and opportunity, despite stated government objectives. The gaps between rich and poor, powerful and powerless, continue to grow — giving rise to political movements that push back against these trends (as explored in Week 3). These movements often reinforce some interests while excluding others, and conflict grows between different parts of society.

**Organisational response to change:**
Organisations respond with seemingly unending processes of change: reorganisation, restructuring, moving location, centralising and de-centralising, introducing new job roles and changing employment practices. An important element of leadership is enabling people to navigate change constructively while providing safe spaces to contribute to change processes and express views when constant change isn't working.

Leadership can inspire people (Week 7), help re-engage those who are unhappy or disillusioned, restore calm and confidence, and divert people from conflict into constructive dialogue.

**However:** It's not always possible to avoid conflict between people with different interests in a quickly changing environment. Conflict plays an essential role in:

- Stopping harmful or unnecessary change
- Pointing out the need for different change
- Defending the interests of those who are marginalised

Leadership involves engaging with conflict in different ways — at times responding to pacify, re-engage, and seek consensus; at other times stepping forward to provoke and sustain conflict to achieve constructive outcomes.

# 2. Leading Change:

### Activity 1 - Leading Change and Encountering Conflict (Gerry Robinson Case):

The BBC series _Can Gerry Robinson Fix the NHS?_ (2007) provides an example of how well-intentioned change can produce conflict.

**Context:** Robinson, a successful businessman, was challenged to address NHS challenges by delivering change at one hospital. He identified that operating theatres often stood empty (including Friday afternoons) and concluded that waiting lists could be reduced by keeping theatres open longer. He gathered key people from surgical teams to develop a plan.

**Key observation:** Changes intended for good can nevertheless produce conflict between different interest groups. The surgical teams had their own interests, schedules, and working patterns that Robinson's "rational" solution disrupted.

This illustrates a tension in change management: what appears straightforward from a systems/efficiency perspective often encounters resistance rooted in legitimate concerns about working conditions, professional autonomy, and practical constraints that outsiders don't immediately see.

# 3. Competing Interests and Objectives:

Healthcare services face challenges in environments characterised by changes in technology, demography, regulation — and resource constraint. Technological change provides opportunities for innovation, but larger ageing populations combined with resource constraints makes implementation difficult.

Healthcare services are highly regulated and intensively performance managed. They depend on employees with highly developed technical and interpersonal skills. Senior managers must manage competing demands from multiple stakeholders:

- Governments
- Patients
- Staff
- Regulators
- Managers
- Clinicians
- Boards of directors
- Citizens
- Other health organisations

**The interests of these stakeholders are very different:**

|Stakeholder|Primary Interest|
|---|---|
|Citizens/Patients|Timely, effective healthcare when needed|
|Finance managers|Balancing the books|
|Directors|Meeting both patient needs AND financial targets|
|Clinicians|Professional standards, clinical autonomy|
|Regulators|Compliance, safety metrics|
|Staff|Working conditions, job security|

Perhaps inevitably, relationships between stakeholders at times break out into overt hostility and conflict. In complex systems like the NHS, it is enormously challenging for those in senior positions to reconcile competing objectives.

## 3.1. The Chief Executive's Tale:

The King's Fund report _The Chief Executive's Tale_ (Timmins, 2016) gathered narratives from 12 NHS chief executives. The motivation was a perceived crisis of leadership — fast turnover in senior roles combined with increased public scrutiny had made the post unpopular.

### Activity 2 - The View from the Top:

**Factors causing conflict that NHS chief executives must address:**
- Financial pressures and resource constraints
- Regulatory demands and performance management
- Staff expectations and professional interests
- Patient and carer expectations
- Political pressures and media scrutiny
- Competing priorities between different parts of the system

**Leadership characteristics needed in this context:**
- Resilience and emotional stability
- Ability to hold multiple perspectives simultaneously
- Willingness to engage with conflict rather than avoid it
- Transparency and openness
- Capacity to build coalitions and find common ground

### 3.1.1. Conflict: Causes and Leadership Responses:

### Activity 3 - Examples of Conflict:

**Catherine Beardshaw (Warrington):**

|Causes of Conflict|Leadership Response|
|---|---|
|Financial problems larger than disclosed|Engagement with consultants|
|High CEO turnover (6 in 7-8 years)|Commitment (promised 5 years, stayed 4.5)|
|Disengaged consultants|Transparency ("come and work with us")|
|Aggressive patients/families|Anger (acknowledged but managed)|
|Regulatory scrutiny (38 people at quality summit)|Supporting staff wellbeing|

**Ben Gowland:**
- Resource scarcity causing arguments over funding allocation
- Relations with local authority strained by cuts
- "It wasn't personalities. They all worked fine. But some of the cuts the local authority was having to make year on year…"

**Sir Jonathan Michael:**
- Pressure from strategic health authority for quick results
- Pushed back: "Get off my back. Let me get on with the job and I'll deliver. But I'm not going to deliver it in six months."
- Used experience and reputation to create space for action

**Karen Dowman:**
- Contradictory demands: "On the one hand they want us to be independent and free and innovative and the next moment they want to control our every waking moment."
- Response: Selective non-compliance ("deleted the lot of them")
- Acknowledged this was possible because of approaching retirement: "I'd probably not have deleted those six emails 10 years ago!"

### 3.1.2. Conflict: Leadership Strategies:

### Activity 4 - Strategies for Coping with Conflict:

**Strategies identified from the case studies:**

- Engagement and dialogue
- Transparency and openness
- Building coalitions and teams
- Pushing back on unreasonable demands
- Selective compliance/non-compliance
- Supporting staff through pressure
- Acknowledging anger while managing it
- Making commitments and keeping them
- Bringing in specialist help (turnaround teams)

[O'Neil and McLarnon (2024)](https://bmcproc.biomedcentral.com/) emphasise that effective conflict management is crucial for leadership success — leaders who adeptly navigate conflicts can enhance team cohesion and performance. Leaders should be adaptable, employing different strategies to address diverse situations.

**Key insight:** People at the top experience challenge and conflict as they respond to, introduce, and manage change. To lead from the top in continual change is enormously complex and personally challenging — individuals cannot enact this leadership in isolation. Their choice of strategies reflects not only preference but also context.

## 3.2. Patient and Carer Perspectives:

Leadership in complex healthcare services comes from multiple sources — but most important is the leadership role played by patients and carers, who have the best understanding of ill health and how the system really works.

Patients and carers influence the shaping of services:
- At the everyday level, interacting with medical staff
- By complaining
- By campaigning and advocating for better provision

Campaign groups and charities (Patients Association, Healthwatch) enable patients to have a voice in service development and challenge priorities and practices.

### Activity 5 - The Patient's Right to Be Rude:

[Burnell (2016)](https://www.nursingtimes.net/clinical-archive/leadership/the-right-to-be-rude-managing-of-conflict/7001480.article) argues that patients have "the right to be rude" and offers healthcare staff strategies for dealing with challenges from unhappy patients.

**The DELUDE Model for coping with conflict:**

|Letter|Strategy|
|---|---|
|**D**|Don't take offence|
|**E**|Empathise|
|**L**|Listen|
|**U**|Understand|
|**D**|De-escalate|
|**E**|Engage constructively|
Rather than being drawn into an uncooperative relationship, nurses who choose not to take offence but instead listen, care, ask questions, and empathise may find a more constructive way forward.

## 3.3. Conflict and Campaigns:

It's not always possible to resolve conflicts at a one-to-one level. Patients and carers who are dissatisfied can come together to campaign for changes in policy and practice.

### Activity 6 - Patient and Carer Campaigns (John's Campaign):

**John's Campaign** — initiated by Nicci Gerrard and Julia Jones — campaigned for carers to have greater access to hospital wards to support family members with dementia.

**Key success factors:**
1. **Story telling** — Nicci's moving article in _The Observer_ launched the campaign, using personal narrative to create emotional connection.
2. **Coalition building** — Alzheimer's Society, Carers UK, and Parkinson's UK backed the campaign; political support from all parties.
3. **Timing** — "The system is buckling so much that doctors and nurses can see how carers could be part of the solution."
4. **Turning 'I' into 'we'** — "If we get together and turn 'I' into 'we', that is when change is going to happen."

This exemplifies what Heifetz (1994) describes as [[../Glossary#^LWA-def|Leadership Without Authority]] — leadership that comes from the bottom rather than the top. People without formal position draw on different kinds of authority — in this case, authority derived from experience recognised by others as similar to their own.

---

# 4. Constructive Dissent:

Professor Keith Grint argues that being able to express dissent or disagreement constructively is an important leadership practice — [[../Glossary#^CD-def|Constructive Dissent]].

**Why constructive dissent is challenging:**
1. **We associate dissent with destruction.** We see political, religious, and social dissent in history involving dismantling structures. We hear narratives of how individuals who expressed dissent (whistle-blowing, refusing to participate in poor practice) have been marginalised or excluded.
2. **It doesn't fit traditional leadership ideas.** Traditional views convey that a leader is always positive and always in charge.
3. **It's easier to be negative.** Negativity tends to be destructive, self-interested, and closes down debate. Constructive dissent finds a way to disagree that moves debate forwards, engages with shared interests, offers alternatives, and commits to testing those alternatives.
    

**Grint's Framework:**

| Quadrant          | Leader Type                                                       | Follower Type           | Outcome              |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- | -------------------- |
| 1. Emperor        | Hierarchy, Superior Leaders                                       | Irresponsible Followers | Destructive Consent  |
| 2. Cat Herder     | Anarchy, No Leaders                                               | Independent Individuals | Destructive Dissent  |
| 3. White Elephant | Theocracy, Divine Leaders                                         | Disciple Followers      | Constructive Consent |
| 4. Wheelwright    | [[../Glossary#^Het-def Heterarchy\|Heterarchy]], Socratic Leaders | Responsible Followers   | Constructive Dissent |

**X-axis:** Increasing independence from leader **Y-axis:** Increasing commitment to community goals

The ideal is **Quadrant 4 (Wheelwright)**: heterarchy rather than hierarchy, with leadership distributed and moving between people depending on situation. Leaders are "Socratic" — encouraging debate in the tradition of Socrates.

### Activity 7 - Reading (Historical Examples):

**Failure to express or hear dissent can have catastrophic consequences:**

**Sir Clowdisley Shovell (1707):** A British Admiral who allegedly hanged a sailor who insisted the fleet was heading for rocks off the Isles of Sicily. The fleet was subsequently lost on those "non-existent" rocks with 800-2,000 dead.

**Vice-Admiral Sir George Tryon (1893):** Insisted the fleet turn towards each other in insufficient space. Despite warnings from several subordinates that the operation was impossible, Tryon insisted on execution. 358 sailors drowned including Tryon. At court martial, Rear Admiral Markham was asked why he complied if he knew it was wrong. His response: "I thought Admiral Tryon must have some trick up his sleeve."

The court found Tryon to blame but accepted that "it would be fatal for the Navy to encourage subordinates to question superordinates."

**Modern parallel — Facebook/Cambridge Analytica:** Whistleblowers raised concerns about privacy issues, but warnings were largely ignored. The scandal led to public investigations and decline in user trust. Only after external pressure did leadership address concerns more openly.

**Key insight from Grint:** Failure to practise constructive dissent leads to "inappropriate subordination" or "irresponsible followers" — people follow hierarchical leadership without question despite holding dissenting views. Followers become "yes people," and their consent becomes destructive.

[Edmondson (2023)](https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/mckinsey-quarterly) argues that leaders should actively encourage dissenting opinions, viewing them as opportunities for growth and innovation. Creating an environment where team members feel safe to voice differing opinions can enhance engagement and uncover valuable insights.

# 5. Block Case Study:

**Case Study — Susan 5:**

Susan is invited to become a non-executive director on a local hospital trust board. The chair is a client of her bank, the bank supports this as CSR work, and Susan values accessible healthcare.

At an observer board meeting, the chief executive proposes closing three community hospitals and centralising services on the main site — arguing this is better use of limited resources and will allow capital investment from selling the sites.

**Opposition emerges:**
- **Doctors' representative:** Proposed modernisation doesn't provide suitable environment for latest medical interventions.
- **Nursing representative:** No consultation with nursing staff who will resist change of work pattern and location.
- **Patient representative:** Patients prefer local services and will find it difficult to travel; local patient group already preparing a protest campaign.

The chief executive explodes: "You simply don't understand the pressures there are!" The chair intervenes: "Let's take a breathing space before next week's meeting."
## What Should Susan Do?

> [!DANGER] Option A
> 
> I will join the board, but only if it's clear that they'll stand their ground on the proposed changes. Having studied the financial data, it's clear that change is necessary. I know people don't like change, and the board needs to work with management on implementing changes with care, yet the proposals must continue, even if it means conflict with staff and patient groups. The board members have all the expertise they need.

> [!INFO] Option B
> 
> I haven't signed the agreement yet. Now that I understand the conflict at the heart of the trust, I need to know more to see if I can play a useful role. I can see board members are under tremendous pressure, and some have limited understanding of the financial situation. Perhaps I can play a supportive role by drawing on my financial expertise to translate figures and increase understanding all round.

> [!SUCCESS] Option C
> 
> I can see I could play an important role, bringing an outside perspective into difficult debates ahead. However, I'm concerned the board is pressing ahead without really listening to different perspectives around the table. So I'll join the trust board and ask the chair if I can help facilitate a listening exercise between board and staff, and another between board and local patients' group. We need to find safe and constructive ways for staff to express different perspectives legitimately and share in decision making, as they may have insight the board hasn't considered. In the meantime, I'll get to grips with the financial data. I really do need to learn much more.

## My Choice - Option C:

**Option A** is problematic because:
- It assumes the financial data tells the complete story — but the doctors' representative raised clinical concerns about the modernisation plan itself.
- It treats opposition as simply "people don't like change" rather than engaging with substantive objections.
- It perpetuates the "Emperor" model (Grint's Quadrant 1): hierarchy with irresponsible followers leading to destructive consent.
- Susan would be joining a board that has already dismissed dissent rather than engaged with it.

**Option B** has merit but is limited:
- Correctly identifies that Susan needs more information.
- Financial translation is valuable — but frames the problem as primarily one of understanding rather than legitimate competing interests.
- Doesn't address the underlying conflict or create space for constructive dissent.

**Option C** works because:
- It recognises that different stakeholders have legitimate perspectives that may contain insights the board has missed.
- It creates structures for [[../Glossary#^CD-def|constructive dissent]] — safe spaces for staff and patients to express views constructively.
- It acknowledges Susan's own knowledge gaps ("I really do need to learn much more").
- It positions Susan as a facilitator of dialogue rather than simply an enforcer of financial discipline.
- It aligns with the "Wheelwright" model (Grint's Quadrant 4): heterarchy with responsible followers and constructive dissent.

**The deeper issue:** The chief executive's explosion ("You simply don't understand the pressures!") reveals a breakdown in communication. The board has reached a decision without adequately engaging with the perspectives of those who will implement it and be affected by it. Option C addresses this structural problem rather than just the immediate conflict.

**Connection to [[../Glossary#^SI-def|Situational Leadership]]:** This situation calls for a supportive/delegating style that values relationships and facilitates dialogue — not a directing style that pushes through change regardless of opposition.

# Summary:

This week covered three main areas:
1. **Conflict in changing environments** — Complex organisational contexts with continuing change and uncertainty lead to conflict due to competing perspectives, interests, and objectives of various stakeholders. Conflict is often inevitable and sometimes necessary.
2. **Leadership strategies for conflict** — Chief executives and frontline staff adopt different strategies: engagement, transparency, pushing back, selective compliance, building coalitions. Patients and carers also exercise leadership through complaints, campaigns, and advocacy.
3. **Constructive dissent** — Expressing disagreement constructively is an important leadership practice. It requires followers to be independent but committed to organisational goals, and leaders who encourage debate (Socratic/Wheelwright model). Failure to practice constructive dissent can lead to catastrophic outcomes.
    

**Key points:**
- In changing environments, conflict is caused by different perspectives, interests, and objectives of various stakeholders.
- It's not always the task of leadership to reduce conflict — sometimes leadership involves provoking conflict to bring differences to the surface and achieve positive outcomes.
- Strategies effective in bringing positive outcomes from conflict include listening, speaking up, and attempting to understand alternative perspectives.

# Reflection and Sharing:

The idea of [[../Glossary#^CD-def|constructive dissent]] is genuinely useful — it reframes conflict from something to be avoided into something that can be channelled productively. The historical examples (Shovell, Tryon) are sobering reminders that "destructive consent" has real costs.

However, I'm struck by the gap between theory and practice here. The module acknowledges that "individuals who have expressed dissent have all too often been marginalised or excluded" — yet still recommends dissent as a leadership practice. This creates a real tension: the person exercising constructive dissent takes on personal risk for organisational benefit, but the organisation often fails to reward (and may punish) that risk-taking.

Karen Dowman's comment is revealing: "I'd probably not have deleted those six emails 10 years ago!" Her capacity for constructive non-compliance was enabled by approaching retirement — she could afford consequences that earlier-career leaders cannot. This suggests that constructive dissent is partly a function of job security and career stage, not just individual courage or skill.

The DELUDE model for patient interactions is practical, but it places the burden of emotional labour entirely on the healthcare worker. "Don't take offence" is good advice, but it also means staff absorb the costs of system failures they didn't create. There's something uncomfortable about a framework that asks frontline workers to be endlessly patient while structural problems remain unaddressed.

The Susan case study illustrates how easy it is for boards to dismiss legitimate concerns as "people don't like change." The chief executive's explosion suggests she's under genuine pressure — but pressure doesn't justify ignoring clinical concerns about whether the proposed modernisation actually serves patients well. Option C's listening exercise is the right approach, but it requires a board willing to hear things it might not want to hear. That willingness can't be assumed.
