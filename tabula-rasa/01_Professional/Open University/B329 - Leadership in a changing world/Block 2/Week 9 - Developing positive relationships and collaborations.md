# Introduction:

The main topics of Week 9 are building upon the themes of diversity, inclusiveness, and situation leadership. By introducing complimentary themes of **collaboration and relationships building.**
## Key Questions:

1. What is collaboration and why is it important?
2. What are the main leadership activities that can support collaboration?
3. What are the main qualities of **Collaboration**

***

# 1. Understanding Collaboration:

People are encouraged to respond to problems with precarity and turbulence by working together to achieve their aims; sharing info, combining knowledge, leveraging different skills, finding out alternatives, etc.

The idea of [[../Glossary#^Collaboration-def|Collaboration]] has been explored by various fields: economics, sociology, anthropology, psychology, political science, and management offer different perspectives.

| Field                     | Example                                                                                                                |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Biology                   | Organisms working together to maximise long-term opportunities for their genes                                         |
| Technological studies     | Software packages enabling remote teams to work together through communication, cooperation, and problem-solving tools |
| Music                     | Participation of many people in a performance                                                                          |
| Research                  | Researchers working together to produce new scientific knowledge                                                       |
| Organisational literature | Broad concept encompassing partnerships, alliances, and various forms of working together                              |

Hence, such terms as "partnership", "alliance", "collaboration" have different meanings and interpretations. [(Huxham and Vangen, 2005, p. 1)]([Managing to Collaborate | The Theory and Practice of Collaborative Adv](https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/mono/10.4324/9780203010167/managing-collaborate-chris-huxham-siv-vangen)) note that there isn't a consensus of what we define as collaboration, it differs between contexts.

e.g. Collaboration can mean sharing an opinion/information or actually working together. With anything else in between also being a possible interpretation.
## 1.1. The Importance of Collaboration:

[(Pearl et all. 2015)](https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/The_Collaboration_Breakthrough.html?id=ccmNCwAAQBAJ&redir_esc=y) as part of the Collaboration Breakthrough Team defined a collaborative environment as and environment where you and colleagues can:

- Share a clear and common purpose.
- Have open and respectful conversations.
- Can easily build commitment to new ideas and ways of doing things.
- Have simple tools and processes that guide decisions, actions and accountability.
- Have the opportunity every day to learn and grow.
- Have complete trust and confidence in each other.

Within a collaborative workplace you would be likely to achieve goals, and have loyal and enthusiastic customers and partners as well as feel an increased degree of personal ownership, and be able to progress, innovate, and grow.

Collaboration and bringing people together gives them a stronger sense of purpose and appreciation for working together as well as avoids individual overload. (e.g. the whole is worth more than the sum of the parts)

[Carmeli and Schaubroeck (2023)](https://www.iosrjournals.org/iosr-jbm/papers/Vol20-issue12/Version-6/F2012065458.pdf) explain that a more collaborative leadership approach is vital for fostering creativity between teams. Ideas are shared, diverse perspectives are leveraged, and team performance is raised. Effective leaders can stimulate collaborative behaviour in this way to enhance collective problem solving.

### 1.1.1. The Six Collaboration Skills:

1. **Think Relationships**
	1. Consider what value does this relationships provide to you? What about the opposite person? What type of relationship is it? How much trust exists?
	2. We can use tools like [[../Extension Concepts/Relationship Maps|Relationship Maps]] to analyse professional relationships.
2. **Build Trust**
	1. Actively cultivate goodwill over time, Martin Nowak's work on evolutionary research applies here, where we have three main concepts
		1. **Be optimistic** - Enter relationships expecting them to work.
		2. **Be generous** - Signal investment and commitment early.
		3. **Be forgiving** - Assume misunderstanding before malice.
3. **Know Yourself**
	1. Use instruments like the [[../Extension Concepts/Psychometric Instruments|Thomas-Kilmann Conflict Mode]] Inventory.
4. **Use Prompts to Shift Behaviour**
	1. Use physical props, mannerisms, or clothing to change and set the mood in a more collaborative direction.
5. **Signal Generously**
	1. **Gifts** - Not just money, but time, attention, and information. Coffee's, Lunch, listening to people, remembering them, etc.
	2. Add money to the emotional bank account.
6. **Be Analytical**
	1. Business case analysis - collaboration takes energy make sure the payoff is worth it.
	2. Relationship diagnostic - assess what works and what isn't.
	3. Virtual meetings - recognise that these take different skills and you lose a lot from them.

### 1.1.2. Which Skill is Most Key to You?

I'd say skill 6; being analytical is most important to me. This is because I like to measure up costs and benefits appropriately. I dislike investing my time, energy, or money into activities which are superficial or have no/little payoff.

Also skill 3; knowing yourself seems important as well, I think if you know your own strengths and weaknesses that you can adapt accordingly when working with other people. If you listen and look at what they are doing, you can translate and filter your responses and demeanour into a way they appreciate.
### 1.1.3. Are there Any Skills You Would Question?

I'd question about the be forgiving aspect of the build trust. If someone repeatedly breaks your own trust and doesn't take responsibility for their mistakes or shortcomings, they at that point once you have the evidence you can be more punitive or less collaborative. e.g. if someone has shown that they will repletely extract from your without reciprocation, then the collaboration won't happen as both parties aren't invested. 

But you have to go into these relationships being trusting and giving the benefit of the doubt first. 
## 1.2. Are You Collaborative?:

Sometimes working with others can be difficult, we may be taught how to work with other people, but it depends on the type of person or skills that you have - you may lean to cooperation or competition - either is fine.

I got a 65/100 - being a **Doubter**:

*You hold some beliefs and values that suggest that you don’t always see the value in collaborative work. Perhaps you’ve been burned in the past. Or perhaps collaboration doesn’t come naturally or easily to you. Spend some time thinking about what you can gain personally and professionally from the opportunity to work collaboratively with others. Continue to refine your thinking, especially it relates to your working collaboratively*
## 1.3. Becoming More Collaborative:

A jazz band is an example of collaboration, each player sounds good on their own, but together the music comes alive. The result is stronger than each individual.

The same principles also apply in business, by building trust and open communication an organization can be more efficient by using teamwork and a shared sense of purpose.

Reid Hoffman, the founder of linked in had been on the board for Google, eBay, and PayPal. Then had the idea of linking business professionals together, hence LinkedIn has become a titan within the corporate and professional world.

### 1.3.1 Collaboration and Networking:

#### What Job Do I want to Do and what Qualifications Do I Have?

Cybersecurity Job / SOC Analyst:
1. Degree - Shows formal education and a dedication to learning and personal development.
2. CDSA HTB - Shows technical competence, demonstrates practical threat detection and analysis skills.
3. Security+ - Appeals to HR and managers and fulfils their criteria in what they are looking for in a graduate or entry level.
4. Attention to detail - Helps with the job role, SOC analysts require lots of documentation writing and reading playbooks. Creating incidents and reports is key.
5. Programming/Scripting foundation - I've written programs in various programming languages (Java, C/C++/C#, Python, PHP, Bash, JavaScript, etc.) so I can do automation well.

#### LinkedIn Update:

I'd do the following:

**Headline:**
- Change to something like: *"Cybersecurity Student or SOC Analyst in Training"* 

**About/Summary Section:**
- Lead with your cybersecurity focus, not general IT
- Mention your hands-on lab work explicitly: "Developing defensive security skills through systematic Hack The Box challenges"
- Reference your documentation methodology — shows analytical rigor

**Experience/Projects Section:**
- Add a "Cybersecurity Projects" section featuring your HTB work
- Frame your documentation systems as "Security Research Documentation"
- Include any incident analysis or threat hunting exercises you've completed

**Skills Section — Add:**
- SIEM concepts, Log Analysis, Threat Detection, Incident Response, Network Security Fundamentals, Security Documentation, MITRE ATT&CK Framework.

**Certifications Section:**
- List "CDSA — In Progress" with expected completion date
- Add any completed HTB certifications or paths

**Education:**
- Emphasize cybersecurity-relevant coursework
#### LinkedIn Message:

I'd be targeting larger MSSP which prioritise analyst development:

Binary Defence — MSSP with strong analyst development programs
Secureworks — Large enterprise SOC with structured career progression

I'm currently completing my degree and working toward my CDSA certification while building hands-on skills through Hack The Box labs. I'm particularly interested in SOC analyst roles and noticed your work at [Company Name].

I'd appreciate the chance to connect and learn more about your path into security operations. If you have a few minutes for a brief conversation about what you look for in entry-level analysts, I'd be grateful.

All the best,
Alex

# 2. Using Leadership to Support Collaboration:

Leading effectively requires not only you developing your own ability to lead, but to inspire others or to support inclusiveness, offering appropriate activities to build collaboration both inside and outside the workplace.

[(Huxham and Vangen, 2005)](https://oro.open.ac.uk/1701/) state that there are two different approaches of collaboration, following the spirit of it or "collaborative thuggery"

| Facilitative activities undertaken in 'the spirit of collaboration'                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Manipulative activities which are perceived as 'collaborative thuggery'                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Encouraging activities** to build trust, manage power relations, facilitate communication and handle different interests of members. Collectively, these activities can be viewed as leadership efforts to support members in working effectively with each other, to give them a voice and achieve consensus. (This leadership style may remind you of the supporting style discussed in Week 8.)                                                                                                                                                                              | **Differing aims, perspectives, needs or levels of commitment.** When leaders and members disagree with each other, leaders must resort to adopting more pragmatic approaches that may seem inconsistent with the spirit of collaboration. (This leadership style may remind you of the directing style discussed in Week 8.)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| **Embracing the right kind of members.** This may occupy leaders' attention on a continuing basis, not just at the start of a collaboration. In their effort to recruit a capable team, leaders can be torn between trying to attract both the partners who are needed for the collaboration to exist or succeed and those who really wish to be partners.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | **Manipulating the collaborative agenda.** Some aspects of manipulating the collaborative agenda can be indirect, unintended or even unconscious, although sometimes leaders influence the agenda more directly without consulting the team members. However, leaders may face challenges in this, since it's not easy to make members understand important issues or to influence the agenda by stealth. Moreover, leaders may find it difficult to decide independently how to move the agenda forward or to manoeuvre members into addressing their agenda. |
| **Empowering members to enable participation.** Creating a participation-friendly environment is important yet challenging. It's no easy task for a leader to maintain an infrastructure that allows all members to participate, irrespective of skills, or to maintain open communication with dispersed members or provide specific help to individuals.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | **Playing politics.** Leaders often find it necessary to employ politics to make collaboration work, even in unorthodox ways. This can be challenging, however, since probing the political undercurrents between members, not to mention rival organisations, is a ticklish business. It's also challenging to discover via networking who is worth paying attention to and who isn't.                                                                                                                                                                        |
| **Involving and supporting all members.** Even if a leader creates a team in which all members are involved and supported, problems may arise from some partners being considered more equal than others. It can also be difficult to ensure that all members are equally committed when some might have a strong loyalty to one member organisation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| **Mobilising members to make things happen.** Empowering team members and making sure they feel involved are important factors to consider, but they're not enough alone to make a collaboration work effectively. Leaders also need to make sure that the whole team works together in support of the collaboration, even if their individual incentives lie in different directions, while at the same time recognising that all members need something in return. They also need to mobilise members with different levels of commitment to and awareness of the task at hand. |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
Leaders may have to act with thuggery rather than the true spirit of collaboration, both of these are usually present to a certain degrees within collaborative environments.
## 2.1. Other Ways Leaders Can Support Collaboration:

[Goman (2011)](https://archive.org/details/silentlanguageof0000goma/mode/2up) asserts that the following can also help foster collaboration:

1. **Realising that silo mentality can negatively affect your business.** ‘Silo mentality’ is a term that describes a situation where some people in an organisation refuse to share information with others.
2. **Putting people at the centre of your collaboration.** Realising that collaboration is a change in attitudes and behaviours of people throughout an organisation, and that collaboration is a human issue.
3. **Making collaboration a strategy of organisational change.** No matter how creative, smart and able a leader is, they cannot change an organisation, department or team without the help of others. Those who will be affected by the change should be involved and consulted.
4. **Creating a common vision.** A successful leader brings all employees together around a common vision and shared purpose. However, a vision becomes a powerful tool that connects people only when those people played a part in its creation.
5. **Making use of diverse thinking to solve problems.** Leaders should take advantage of diverse thinking, using it to consider perspectives and possibilities that they might have otherwise missed.
6. **Helping employees to develop relationships.** The interrelationships between team members can make or break a collaboration. Allow team members time to build their relationships and get to know each other before you ask them to work together.
7. **Building trust.** Trust in the integrity and honesty of its members is the glue that keeps a team together. It is a vital ingredient of informed collaboration, and leaders should demonstrate it by being open and communicating honestly with their team.
8. **Being careful of your body language.** A leader’s body language will indicate if they are receptive to other people’s ideas, so pay attention to how your non-verbal communication makes you come across to others.

### Activity 4 - Leadership Activities that Support Collaboration:

#### Description:

Imagine you’re the leader of a department in a large manufacturing organisation. Your team consists of 30 people. Over the last two years, your staff have received an annual pay rise of 2.5%.

At a meeting with head office, you were informed that none of the staff will receive a pay rise this year, because of a drop in the company’s sales revenue. Although the business has started doing better already, the senior leadership team believes they should be careful and allow the organisation to recover financially and safeguard jobs rather than giving pay rises, aiming instead to readdress the pay-rise issue next year. It is your responsibility to inform your team that they won’t be getting a pay rise this year.

Until now, you’ve had a good relationship with your staff and have built a strong collaborative culture. However, as soon as you announce the news about the lack of pay rise, the climate at work changes: people are angry at you, they’re not as committed as they used to be, and they don’t seem keen to work together as a team or, indeed, with you.
#### How Can You Encourage Collaboration?

**Empowering and involving** staff is critical, you need to explain why the decision making was made, even though you didn't make the decision yourself. This gives space and room for discussion about them feeling heard rather than being dismissed.

**Managing meaning** is also important, since you can't change the pay decision. You want to build the narrative that everyone is weathering the storm together, it creates an idea that they can work with, but still doesn't diffuse valid frustration.

**Empowering within constraints** you can offer develop opportunities, flexibility, recognition, or input into how next years pay discussions are approached.

#### Which Activities Have Suffered as a Result of no Pay Rise?

**Trust** is the most damaged aspect, even though you didn't make the decision there was an element of trust that their commitment and struggles would be rewarded. It's not just about honesty, but if people think leadership as their interests at heart.

**Profits over people** is another aspect that will have grown, regardless of if its fair or not, people feel as if they are costs to be managed not partner/people in the organisation. 

#### Which Activities Would Help You Rebuild Collaboration?

Rebuilding trust is the most critical aspect here, you have to be very transparent and honest within the situation. Don't minimize or overexplain the rationale. Be transparent about what metrics are being watched and how pay will be revisited in the future. Build informal check-ins where people can voice concerns without feeling monitored or abstracted away in a grievance process.

You also need to produce a vision beyond - survive until next year. Define a near-team goal that can be achieved so that the team could be enthused beyond pay, such as skill development or input into decision making. By connecting work to the companies recovery, you can also say if we achieve this goal, we can push for more pay next month.
## 2.2. Collaborative Leadership:

Leaders need to lead diverse teams beyond established boundaries and create a culture of inclusiveness in order to bring people and their ideas, experiences, and knowledge together to grow the organisation and compete.

Bringing all of this together, we can use [[../Glossary#^CL-def|Collaborative Leadership]] as a way of achieving these goals. 

[Chrislip (2002)](https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/The_Collaborative_Leadership_Fieldbook.html?id=dFzXJ7EGFGkC&redir_esc=y) suggests through the principle of Skilful Means, that collaborative leadership consists of the following three main traits:

- **Collaborative problem solving and decision making.** Instead of the leader deciding what to do and then giving directions to the group, the team identifies problems as a group and decides collectively on the best way to act, counting on the leader’s support.
- **Leadership of the process, not of the people.** The aim here is not to lead people towards a particular goal, decision or direction but to support the collaborative process, to grow from an independent to an interdependent culture and structure that can exploit different mindsets and work beyond organisational boundaries.
- **Open process.** With this trait, the leader doesn’t have a particular direction or goal in mind. Instead, any direction or goal emerges as a result of collaborative decision making, and the end result is decided collectively by all team members.

The emphasis within this approach is not what leaders do, but bringing people together in constructive ways so they produce original visions and creative solutions to deal with problems faced by an organisation/department/group.

**Collectively, multiple brains together are more capable than one.** 

An additional effect of this is that open communication and collaborative leadership enhance employee motivation, commitment, satisfaction and retention. 

***Why?*** Employees have a greater sense of agency and power within their environment, rather than a feeling of being managed or controlled. Autonomy is enhanced.

### Activity 5 - Exploring Collaborative Leadership:

*Referencing an article on [Abraham Lincoln](https://go.gale.com/ps/i.do?id=GALE%7CA334606599&v=2.1&u=tou&it=r&p=AONE&sw=w&aty=shibboleth)*
#### 1. What Are the Five Main Characteristics of Collaborative Leadership?:

According to the article, Lincoln's approach reflects these five key characteristics:

1. **Are driven to achieve the goal, but keep their egos in check** — Lincoln held no grudges and focused on preserving the Union rather than self-promotion. He diffused criticism with humour and stayed focused on the larger mission.
2. **Listen carefully to understand others' perspectives** — Lincoln had an unusual ability to see things through others' eyes, including his critics. He used this skill with his fractious cabinet to refine the timing and wording of the proclamation.
3. **Seek win-win solutions** — He framed emancipation to appeal to different groups' interests: offering financial compensation to border states, emphasizing safety and unity to Northerners, and connecting abolition to the war effort.
4. **Use "pull" more than "push"** — Rather than forcing his position through authority, Lincoln tapped into others' values and goals to move them toward a common direction. He twice asked his cabinet for input and incorporated their suggestions.
5. **Think strategically and connect the project to a larger purpose** — Lincoln spent countless hours building a broad coalition, filling government positions with people from all factions to connect them to his larger mission of preserving the Union.

#### 2. What Situations Have You Been in and how Could You Use the 5 Characteristics to Improve Them?:

My parents wanted to decide what to eat for lunch and dinner, I have certain foods or styles of cooking that I like, but instead of advocating for my own interests, it makes more sense for me to **listen carefully and understand other people's desires.** 

I know that my mum is more health conscious and wants food that is healthy, where as my dad wants food that tastes good primarily. Each have certain dishes (Irish stew, Tapioca, Corned beef) which they dislike and they express it in different ways. I can suggest food or ideas that promote both interests or frame foods in a way that captures the others needs (e.g. Broccoli would have a good amount of fibre and vitamin K).

Also, **thinking strategically and connecting it to a broader purpose** helps as well. Figuring out what to eat isn't just about a meal. It's about having order and structure and planning out the day, when a consensus is reached and both parties are satisfied the rest of the day goes better with less friction.

# 3. Assessing and Sharing Your Knowledge:

I got a 71 points which maps to the following:

*You have excellent shared-leadership capabilities. You are a very collaborative leader, able to provide the necessary support and guidance to your staff while at the same time encouraging them to express their opinions and participate in the decision-making process. You take advantage of opportunities to show others that they are valued and offer possibilities for everyone to contribute to discussions. You also foster a team spirit and are happy to share with others. However, achieving a high score here doesn’t mean that there is no room for improvement. Take a look at the statements which support collaborative work. This will indicate the areas to focus on in order to improve your shared-leadership capabilities.*

# 4. Block Case Study:

**THIS RELATES TO THE TMA 01!**

> [!ABSTRACT] Case Study - Susan 3:
> 
>Susan’s senior leadership team has asked her to produce a new product that they believe could be sold not only to large corporations (their usual clients) but also to organisations in the education, health and social services sectors. 
>
>To help ensure the product’s success, they have suggested that Susan consider partnering with the bank’s research and development (R&D) department. 
>
>However, Susan is aware that her team and the R&D department have distinct work styles, values and goals. As a result, fostering effective collaboration between the two groups will require careful coordination and open dialogue.


## What Should Susan Do?

> [!DANGER] Option A
> 
> I understand that the team may face some challenges working with the R&D department, but we can’t always choose who we collaborate with. The most important thing is to create the right product, and my team doesn’t have the experience or, perhaps, the knowledge to do so. 
> 
> They have to accept that, in working with R&D, we can all work towards a common goal and we will all benefit from a good result. As well as this, it’s a good opportunity for my team to learn and grow, which is important both for them and for me, as I have to keep head office happy. 
> 
> It’s part of my job to bring people to work together, even if they’re not very happy about it. So I’ll let the senior leadership team know that my team will collaborate with the R&D department. How hard can it be?

>[!INFO] Option B
>
>I can understand why my team thinks it will be difficult to work with the R&D department, as their culture is very different from ours, and if my team outright refuses to work with them, any forced collaboration will be doomed to fail. 
>
>Any collaboration with them will only work if the right kind of members are involved and everyone is willing to participate. So I’ll tell the team about head office’s proposal and explain their rationale – that, by bringing these two very different teams together, better solutions will emerge, along with a better product. 
>
>Most importantly, I’ll try to explain to them that we’re all working towards a common goal and I’ll look for win–win solutions – which is, after all, the point of shared leadership. 
>
>I just hope that they’ll agree to work with R&D in the end because, despite the challenges involved, I really believe it will be good both for my team and the bank. But ultimately, it’s up to the team to decide.

> [!SUCCESS] Option C
> 
> It’s difficult to come up with a straightforward answer. I understand how important it is to work collaboratively, but I’m also aware of the challenges involved. The best thing to do is to be flexible. So yes, I’ll tell the team that I believe working together with the R&D department is a good idea. 
> 
> I’ll mobilise them by involving them in achieving that overall goal. I’ll tell them that we’ll decide the main characteristics of the product together and that we’ll discuss how R&D can help them towards this aim. Of course, I know that the team may not be able to have full control of the product specifications, but that’s not so important at this stage; the important thing is to think strategically and put them at the centre of the strategy, building trust and connecting them to a larger purpose. 
> 
> After all, shared leadership is about maintaining a process of engaging collective intelligence to deliver results, even if that’s achieved in conflicting ways. 
> 
> However, if the team really doesn’t want to collaborate with R&D, I’ll go back to head office and try to negotiate the terms of the collaboration in order to offer more reassurances to the team. I’ll also explore the possibility of working with only a few people from R&D rather than the whole department, in the hope that it will be easier for my team to agree to this.

## My Choice - Option C:

**Issues with Option A:**
1. "How hard can it be?" mindset
	1. By dismissing the concerns of genuine challenges that working with R&D and her current team could cause. You end up in a situation where you force compliance, rather than building collaboration.
	2. This undermines the collaboration before it begins and will more likely lead to resentment and resistance. 
2. Product > People focus
	1. There isn't anything wrong with focusing on building a strong product, but if your team senses that you're putting the needs of an organisation or tool above them, they will become more discontented and alienated.
		1. This can lead to a lower quality product being produced, since the people are required to make the product to begin with, take care of your people, and they'll produce a better product.
3. "Keep the head office happy" framing
	1. This framing is destructive, as Susan's decision making is not being founded or motivated by clear leadership principles, yet it is her own self-interests.
		1. This can lead to a slippery slope of where the leadership position serves her own needs rather than the true needs of her team.

**Issues with Option B:**

1. Abdication of responsibility
	1. Susan in this case acknowledges the difficulties, but instead of challenging them or doing something about the cultural differences or spearheading a win-win strategy she passes on the responsibility to her team
		1. This leads to difficulties by omission: it isn't what she's done is wrong, its her lack of decision making which is wrong.
2. Collaboration doomed mindset
	1. This Susan believes that collaboration is doomed from the beginning and has to be carefully managed. The "right members" must be involved and "everyone must work together."
	2. This undermines the more complex nature of collaboration, perhaps some members will not get along - but others will work together, but to suggest that it is broken before it starts it a bit disingenuous.
		1. The framing of "There's going to be challenges and risks, but this collaboration has a large potential for benefits for my team and R&D." is a bit more honest.
		2. I'm mainly against the kind of internal vision which will bleed into her external vision towards her team.

**Option C:**

1. Balance between head office and her team
	1. Susan commits to supporting the head office with the collaboration effort. Whilst giving her team autonomy and say into how the collaboration will be conducted.
2. Strategic framing of R&D
	1. By working with and discussion the product with her team first, and asserting: "how R&D can help us towards this aim". She positions them as a resource or tool to help them rather than a threat.
3. Maintains flexibility
	1. If resistance persists, she can negotiate terms to scale down the collaboration efforts to meet the demands of the head office, whilst also suiting the needs of her team if they are hard against working with R&D
		1. You'll likely have a few people who are willing contribute with R&D because they want that internal (growth, development, something challenging), or external (Visibility, helping leader/manager, reputation).
			1. It could enable you to figure out members value development versus stability, what kind of roles or work they want and prefer.
			2. Still be careful about how you express this, as it could build resentment from other team members if they feel that favouritism is involved.
4. Honesty about constraints
	1. By stating that her team doesn't have full control over the product she is being transparent and not promising things to her team that she can't deliver.
	2. This is important as it keeps and maintains trust within her word. If she had promised decision making and yet non came, there would be the feeling of betrayal and more resistance.
		1. Teams will accept constraints which they understand and are articulated, trust gets eroded when hidden constraints or shifting goalposts are located.

As a final point, for a collaboration to succeed in a real world scenario. Susan would benefit from connecting and working with a leader within R&D, her team would be managed well. But if the R&D team has assumptions or ideas that conflict with her framing or strategy then adaptation would need to occur.

# Reflection and Sharing:

**My Strongest Collaborative Leadership Capacity:** would be my ability to inspire trust through consistent actions and behaviours. By making decisions and following through on my words and actions. When I say to others I'm doing something or I'm on it, they can trust and appreciate that. This models collaborative behaviour throughout an organisation and sets a positive model.

**My Weakest Collaborative Leadership Capacity** would be my interpersonal responses and body language. Sometimes - especially when I'm tired or stressed, I end up adopting a more cold and terse approach, which harms collaboration as it's obvious that I don't want to talk or discuss the topic at hand. Thus negatively impacting interpersonal relationships and collaboration.

To improve upon this, I plan to focus on pausing and building a mental reset before engaging in collaborative discussions and activities when fatigued.
