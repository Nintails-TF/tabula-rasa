# Introduction:

The main topics of Week 9 are building upon the themes of diversity, inclusiveness, and situation leadership. By introducing complimentary themes of **collaboration and relationships building.**
## Key Questions:

1. What is collaboration and why is it important?
2. What are the main leadership activities that can support collaboration?
3. What are the main qualities of **Collaboration**

***

# 1. Understanding Collaboration:

People are encouraged to respond to problems with precarity and turbulence by working together to achieve their aims; sharing info, combining knowledge, leveraging different skills, finding out alternatives, etc.

The idea of [[../Glossary#^Collaboration-def|Collaboration]] has been explored by various fields: economics, sociology, anthropology, psychology, political science, and management offer different perspectives.

| Field                     | Example                                                                                                                |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Biology                   | Organisms working together to maximise long-term opportunities for their genes                                         |
| Technological studies     | Software packages enabling remote teams to work together through communication, cooperation, and problem-solving tools |
| Music                     | Participation of many people in a performance                                                                          |
| Research                  | Researchers working together to produce new scientific knowledge                                                       |
| Organisational literature | Broad concept encompassing partnerships, alliances, and various forms of working together                              |

Hence, such terms as "partnership", "alliance", "collaboration" have different meanings and interpretations. [(Huxham and Vangen, 2005, p. 1)]([Managing to Collaborate | The Theory and Practice of Collaborative Adv](https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/mono/10.4324/9780203010167/managing-collaborate-chris-huxham-siv-vangen)) note that there isn't a consensus of what we define as collaboration, it differs between contexts.

e.g. Collaboration can mean sharing an opinion/information or actually working together. With anything else in between also being a possible interpretation.
## 1.1. The Importance of Collaboration:

[(Pearl et all. 2015)](https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/The_Collaboration_Breakthrough.html?id=ccmNCwAAQBAJ&redir_esc=y) as part of the Collaboration Breakthrough Team defined a collaborative environment as and environment where you and colleagues can:

- Share a clear and common purpose.
- Have open and respectful conversations.
- Can easily build commitment to new ideas and ways of doing things.
- Have simple tools and processes that guide decisions, actions and accountability.
- Have the opportunity every day to learn and grow.
- Have complete trust and confidence in each other.

Within a collaborative workplace you would be likely to achieve goals, and have loyal and enthusiastic customers and partners as well as feel an increased degree of personal ownership, and be able to progress, innovate, and grow.

Collaboration and bringing people together gives them a stronger sense of purpose and appreciation for working together as well as avoids individual overload. (e.g. the whole is worth more than the sum of the parts)

[Carmeli and Schaubroeck (2023)](https://www.iosrjournals.org/iosr-jbm/papers/Vol20-issue12/Version-6/F2012065458.pdf) explain that a more collaborative leadership approach is vital for fostering creativity between teams. Ideas are shared, diverse perspectives are leveraged, and team performance is raised. Effective leaders can stimulate collaborative behaviour in this way to enhance collective problem solving.

### 1.1.1. The Six Collaboration Skills:

1. **Think Relationships**
	1. Consider what value does this relationships provide to you? What about the opposite person? What type of relationship is it? How much trust exists?
	2. We can use tools like [[../Extension Concepts/Relationship Maps|Relationship Maps]] to analyse professional relationships.
2. **Build Trust**
	1. Actively cultivate goodwill over time, Martin Nowak's work on evolutionary research applies here, where we have three main concepts
		1. **Be optimistic** - Enter relationships expecting them to work.
		2. **Be generous** - Signal investment and commitment early.
		3. **Be forgiving** - Assume misunderstanding before malice.
3. **Know Yourself**
	1. Use instruments like the [[../Extension Concepts/Psychometric Instruments|Thomas-Kilmann Conflict Mode]] Inventory.
4. **Use Prompts to Shift Behaviour**
	1. Use physical props, mannerisms, or clothing to change and set the mood in a more collaborative direction.
5. **Signal Generously**
	1. **Gifts** - Not just money, but time, attention, and information. Coffee's, Lunch, listening to people, remembering them, etc.
	2. Add money to the emotional bank account.
6. **Be Analytical**
	1. Business case analysis - collaboration takes energy make sure the payoff is worth it.
	2. Relationship diagnostic - assess what works and what isn't.
	3. Virtual meetings - recognise that these take different skills and you lose a lot from them.

### 1.1.2. Which Skill is Most Key to You?

I'd say skill 6; being analytical is most important to me. This is because I like to measure up costs and benefits appropriately. I dislike investing my time, energy, or money into activities which are superficial or have no/little payoff.

Also skill 3; knowing yourself seems important as well, I think if you know your own strengths and weaknesses that you can adapt accordingly when working with other people. If you listen and look at what they are doing, you can translate and filter your responses and demeanour into a way they appreciate.
### 1.1.3. Are there Any Skills You Would Question?

I'd question about the be forgiving aspect of the build trust. If someone repeatedly breaks your own trust and doesn't take responsibility for their mistakes or shortcomings, they at that point once you have the evidence you can be more punitive or less collaborative. e.g. if someone has shown that they will repletely extract from your without reciprocation, then the collaboration won't happen as both parties aren't invested. 

But you have to go into these relationships being trusting and giving the benefit of the doubt first. 
## 1.2. Are You Collaborative?:

Sometimes working with others can be difficult, we may be taught how to work with other people, but it depends on the type of person or skills that you have - you may lean to cooperation or competition - either is fine.

I got a 65/100 - being a **Doubter**:

*You hold some beliefs and values that suggest that you don’t always see the value in collaborative work. Perhaps you’ve been burned in the past. Or perhaps collaboration doesn’t come naturally or easily to you. Spend some time thinking about what you can gain personally and professionally from the opportunity to work collaboratively with others. Continue to refine your thinking, especially it relates to your working collaboratively*
## 1.3. Becoming More Collaborative:

A jazz band is an example of collaboration, each player sounds good on their own, but together the music comes alive. The result is stronger than each individual.

The same principles also apply in business, by building trust and open communication an organization can be more efficient by using teamwork and a shared sense of purpose.

Reid Hoffman, the founder of linked in had been on the board for Google, eBay, and PayPal. Then had the idea of linking business professionals together, hence LinkedIn has become a titan within the corporate and professional world.

### 1.3.1 Collaboration and Networking:

#### What Job Do I want to Do and what Qualifications Do I Have?

Cybersecurity Job / SOC Analyst:
1. Degree - Shows formal education and a dedication to learning and personal development.
2. CDSA HTB - Shows technical competence, demonstrates practical threat detection and analysis skills.
3. Security+ - Appeals to HR and managers and fulfils their criteria in what they are looking for in a graduate or entry level.
4. Attention to detail - Helps with the job role, SOC analysts require lots of documentation writing and reading playbooks. Creating incidents and reports is key.
5. Programming/Scripting foundation - I've written programs in various programming languages (Java, C/C++/C#, Python, PHP, Bash, JavaScript, etc.) so I can do automation well.

#### LinkedIn Update:

I'd do the following:

**Headline:**
- Change to something like: *"Cybersecurity Student or SOC Analyst in Training"* 

**About/Summary Section:**
- Lead with your cybersecurity focus, not general IT
- Mention your hands-on lab work explicitly: "Developing defensive security skills through systematic Hack The Box challenges"
- Reference your documentation methodology — shows analytical rigor

**Experience/Projects Section:**
- Add a "Cybersecurity Projects" section featuring your HTB work
- Frame your documentation systems as "Security Research Documentation"
- Include any incident analysis or threat hunting exercises you've completed

**Skills Section — Add:**
- SIEM concepts, Log Analysis, Threat Detection, Incident Response, Network Security Fundamentals, Security Documentation, MITRE ATT&CK Framework.

**Certifications Section:**
- List "CDSA — In Progress" with expected completion date
- Add any completed HTB certifications or paths

**Education:**
- Emphasize cybersecurity-relevant coursework
#### LinkedIn Message:

I'd be targeting larger MSSP which prioritise analyst development:

Binary Defence — MSSP with strong analyst development programs
Secureworks — Large enterprise SOC with structured career progression

I'm currently completing my degree and working toward my CDSA certification while building hands-on skills through Hack The Box labs. I'm particularly interested in SOC analyst roles and noticed your work at [Company Name].

I'd appreciate the chance to connect and learn more about your path into security operations. If you have a few minutes for a brief conversation about what you look for in entry-level analysts, I'd be grateful.

All the best,
Alex

# 2. Using Leadership to Support Collaboration:

Leading effectively requires not only you developing your own ability to lead, but to inspire others or to support inclusiveness, offering appropriate activities to build collaboration both inside and outside the workplace.

[(Huxham and Vangen, 2005)](https://oro.open.ac.uk/1701/) state that there are two different approaches of collaboration, following the spirit of it or "collaborative thuggery"

| Facilitative activities undertaken in 'the spirit of collaboration'                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Manipulative activities which are perceived as 'collaborative thuggery'                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Encouraging activities** to build trust, manage power relations, facilitate communication and handle different interests of members. Collectively, these activities can be viewed as leadership efforts to support members in working effectively with each other, to give them a voice and achieve consensus. (This leadership style may remind you of the supporting style discussed in Week 8.)                                                                                                                                                                              | **Differing aims, perspectives, needs or levels of commitment.** When leaders and members disagree with each other, leaders must resort to adopting more pragmatic approaches that may seem inconsistent with the spirit of collaboration. (This leadership style may remind you of the directing style discussed in Week 8.)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| **Embracing the right kind of members.** This may occupy leaders' attention on a continuing basis, not just at the start of a collaboration. In their effort to recruit a capable team, leaders can be torn between trying to attract both the partners who are needed for the collaboration to exist or succeed and those who really wish to be partners.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | **Manipulating the collaborative agenda.** Some aspects of manipulating the collaborative agenda can be indirect, unintended or even unconscious, although sometimes leaders influence the agenda more directly without consulting the team members. However, leaders may face challenges in this, since it's not easy to make members understand important issues or to influence the agenda by stealth. Moreover, leaders may find it difficult to decide independently how to move the agenda forward or to manoeuvre members into addressing their agenda. |
| **Empowering members to enable participation.** Creating a participation-friendly environment is important yet challenging. It's no easy task for a leader to maintain an infrastructure that allows all members to participate, irrespective of skills, or to maintain open communication with dispersed members or provide specific help to individuals.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | **Playing politics.** Leaders often find it necessary to employ politics to make collaboration work, even in unorthodox ways. This can be challenging, however, since probing the political undercurrents between members, not to mention rival organisations, is a ticklish business. It's also challenging to discover via networking who is worth paying attention to and who isn't.                                                                                                                                                                        |
| **Involving and supporting all members.** Even if a leader creates a team in which all members are involved and supported, problems may arise from some partners being considered more equal than others. It can also be difficult to ensure that all members are equally committed when some might have a strong loyalty to one member organisation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| **Mobilising members to make things happen.** Empowering team members and making sure they feel involved are important factors to consider, but they're not enough alone to make a collaboration work effectively. Leaders also need to make sure that the whole team works together in support of the collaboration, even if their individual incentives lie in different directions, while at the same time recognising that all members need something in return. They also need to mobilise members with different levels of commitment to and awareness of the task at hand. |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
Leaders may have to act with thuggery rather than the true spirit of collaboration, both of these are usually present to a certain degrees within collaborative environments.
## 2.1. Other Ways Leaders Can Support Collaboration:

[Goman (2011)](https://archive.org/details/silentlanguageof0000goma/mode/2up) asserts that the following can also help foster collaboration:

1. **Realising that silo mentality can negatively affect your business.** ‘Silo mentality’ is a term that describes a situation where some people in an organisation refuse to share information with others.
2. **Putting people at the centre of your collaboration.** Realising that collaboration is a change in attitudes and behaviours of people throughout an organisation, and that collaboration is a human issue.
3. **Making collaboration a strategy of organisational change.** No matter how creative, smart and able a leader is, they cannot change an organisation, department or team without the help of others. Those who will be affected by the change should be involved and consulted.
4. **Creating a common vision.** A successful leader brings all employees together around a common vision and shared purpose. However, a vision becomes a powerful tool that connects people only when those people played a part in its creation.
5. **Making use of diverse thinking to solve problems.** Leaders should take advantage of diverse thinking, using it to consider perspectives and possibilities that they might have otherwise missed.
6. **Helping employees to develop relationships.** The interrelationships between team members can make or break a collaboration. Allow team members time to build their relationships and get to know each other before you ask them to work together.
7. **Building trust.** Trust in the integrity and honesty of its members is the glue that keeps a team together. It is a vital ingredient of informed collaboration, and leaders should demonstrate it by being open and communicating honestly with their team.
8. **Being careful of your body language.** A leader’s body language will indicate if they are receptive to other people’s ideas, so pay attention to how your non-verbal communication makes you come across to others.

### Activity 4 - Leadership Activities that Support Collaboration:

#### Description:

Imagine you’re the leader of a department in a large manufacturing organisation. Your team consists of 30 people. Over the last two years, your staff have received an annual pay rise of 2.5%.

At a meeting with head office, you were informed that none of the staff will receive a pay rise this year, because of a drop in the company’s sales revenue. Although the business has started doing better already, the senior leadership team believes they should be careful and allow the organisation to recover financially and safeguard jobs rather than giving pay rises, aiming instead to readdress the pay-rise issue next year. It is your responsibility to inform your team that they won’t be getting a pay rise this year.

Until now, you’ve had a good relationship with your staff and have built a strong collaborative culture. However, as soon as you announce the news about the lack of pay rise, the climate at work changes: people are angry at you, they’re not as committed as they used to be, and they don’t seem keen to work together as a team or, indeed, with you.
#### How Can You Encourage Collaboration?

**Empowering and involving** staff is critical, you need to explain why the decision making was made, even though you didn't make the decision yourself. This gives space and room for discussion about them feeling heard rather than being dismissed.

**Managing meaning** is also important, since you can't change the pay decision. You want to build the narrative that everyone is weathering the storm together, it creates an idea that they can work with, but still doesn't diffuse valid frustration.

**Empowering within constraints** you can offer develop opportunities, flexibility, recognition, or input into how next years pay discussions are approached.

#### Which Activities Have Suffered as a Result of no Pay Rise?

**Trust** is the most damaged aspect, even though you didn't make the decision there was an element of trust that their commitment and struggles would be rewarded. It's not just about honesty, but if people think leadership as their interests at heart.

**Profits over people** is another aspect that will have grown, regardless of if its fair or not, people feel as if they are costs to be managed not partner/people in the organisation. 

#### Which Activities Would Help You Rebuild Collaboration?

Rebuilding trust is the most critical aspect here, you have to be very transparent and honest within the situation. Don't minimize or overexplain the rationale. Be transparent about what metrics are being watched and how pay will be revisited in the future. Build informal check-ins where people can voice concerns without feeling monitored or abstracted away in a grievance process.

You also need to produce a vision beyond - survive until next year. Define a near-team goal that can be achieved so that the team could be enthused beyond pay, such as skill development or input into decision making. By connecting work to the companies recovery, you can also say if we achieve this goal, we can push for more pay next month.
