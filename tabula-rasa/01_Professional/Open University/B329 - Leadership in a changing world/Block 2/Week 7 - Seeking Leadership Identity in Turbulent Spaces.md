# Introduction:

The main premise of the 2nd block is to figure out a leadership identity that is positive and resilient in the turbulent and precarious world/environments you are in. The most frequent problem is that when problems arise for whatever reason - having a stable leadership identity is more difficult to follow.

The main idea is to be an inspirational leader that others want to follow and listen to, and whilst I think that goal is noble, I'm more of the opinion that being a decent or mediocre leader first is ideal. I suppose it's a difference in approach - being decent first, then aiming for excellence second.
## Key Questions:

The key questions in this week 7 block are:
- What’s the difference between an [[../Glossary#^Admin-def|Administrator]], a [[../Glossary#^Manager-def|Manager]], and a leader?
- What’s your leadership identity and how can you influence it?
- How can you become an inspiring leader?

***

# 1. Constructing a Leadership Identity:

It's difficult to pin down your own identity and your own characteristics of yourself. You've got a personality, values, ideas, and will continue to evolve in the future as well. 

It's key since it dictates how you interact with others, what you prioritise, what others expect, and what you expect from others, and how your relationships operate.

 [[../Glossary#^Identity-def|Identity]] can be defined in various ways. Multiple disciplines such as political, social science, humanities, business studies, philosophy, psychology, have covered the idea of identity - each having their own angle and perspective, the more you learn the more you realise the deep layers and more material there is.

Another idea, is that **the actions you take bring you towards or further away from certain identities**. Studying brings you together with other university students on your course - as you work together and experience struggles/wins. Or more broadly students as a whole. But it also could bring you away from your family or work - as you choose to spend time studying rather than being with them.

It is always important to consider: **who do I want to be?**
## Activity 1 - Exploring Your Identity:

There are various quizzes or tests designed to categorise your identity. They can capture the broad strokes of a person, but not the fine details.

The identity quiz points towards **Conscientious:**

> *You know how to control yourself. This ability results in positive characteristics, such as reliability, thoroughness, and punctuality. You are a goal-achiever because you have the discipline and you keep working through obstacles. However, you can be a bit of a workaholic, so don't forget to have a little fun sometimes.*
> 
> *Even if your answers to this quiz have pointed out that you are open, conscientious or balanced, you have to keep in your mind that your identity is never definite, complete or stable. Under different circumstances, contexts or situations you may bring a different identity forward, you may provide different answers that emphasise a different identity or aspect of yourself.*
## 1.1. Identity Construction:

Our identity is built from various [[../Glossary#^identity-dimensions-def|Identity Dimensions]]. Constructing it is not easy, nor simple. 

## Activity 2 - Goldsmith's Identity Dimensions:

1. What is your dominant identity types?
	1. My identity is mostly remembered, programmed and in the process of being created.
2. Are you the person you want to be?
	1. I'm moving towards a place where I'm more happy with who I am, even now I don't hate myself, but there are things I would like to change.
3. How would you create a new identity?
	1. Figure out the conscious choices you can make and beliefs you can adopt or shed. I think you take on new identities by living or acting in different ways, showing up when you wouldn't normally or trying a new activity, looking at role models and people who you respect is also critical. 
	2. I'm the person who I am today because I initially tried to do everything right - be a kind person, generous, caring, and have a solid morality. Overtime since I moved away from my hometown in Shetland, my usual attitude was punished and ridiculed, which resulted in me withdrawing more from people. I've always followed and trusted authority - but again, I've been burned by that too.
	3. I'm more of a cynical person who's more aware of ulterior motives and I'm more adapt at reading between the lines. I still harbour a kindness for others and compassion, but it's guarded and only shown rarely to those who deserve it, the public are given the bare minimum.
	4. I've taken the approach of only worrying about or trying to control what I actually have power over, which isn't much, but gives me a path the follow and choices to make that move the needle towards a more disciplined, focussed, and solid version of me.

Examples like this can be referred to as [[../Glossary#^Identity-Construction-def|Identity Construction]]. Which has different perspectives both personally and academically. [Ashforth and Schinoff (2016)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/293025711_Identity_Under_Construction_How_Individuals_Come_to_Define_Themselves_in_Organizations) define identity construction as:

- The development of your values, beliefs, practices, discourses and knowledge.
- The shaping of yourself, usually through a strategic self-presentation that aims to enhance the positive idea that you have about yourself.
- Any effort to produce, maintain or recreate views about yourself.

Identities also change in reference to the environment too - For instance, when interacting with strangers my sister is very polite and clear, but when she's around friends and family - she is a lot more cheeky and loquacious.
## 1.2. Multiple Identities:

Your identity shifts depending on who you are talking to: Speaking to your Dad -> Son, Speaking to Classmate -> Pupil, Speaking at work -> Colleagues/Managers/Administrators/Leaders.

There are certain traits or things you would talk about with a friend whilst at the pub, and there is a way in which you would act at work or during a meeting. Since different audiences value and reward different behaviours.

You want to have a stable core or values, but to express them differently in changing environments, this means that your expression is real and isn't performative, which means people will actually believe and trust you more and you won't deal with psychological turbulence.

### Activity 3 - Exploring Multiple Identities:

I have the following identities:

1. Yin Alex - Family/Friends
	1. Be kind strategically—to those who've earned it, in ways that don't compromise my position, according to principles I've chosen rather than inherited
2. Yang Competitor Alex - Sports/Games
	1. Quietly beat people, assert that your better than them, show them your skills and abilities. Prove them wrong, respect opponents but give them no quarter, whilst smiling at their face. A great game requires a strong opponent, a weak opponent is boring.
3. Calculating Alex - Work/Education
	1. Find the most logical path through the situation, what's REALLY being said here, how can I optimise this or improve that? I don't care about externally weak morals or rules, what's the more efficient path here?
4. Philosopher Alex - When feeling unfulfilled or aimless
	1. Is what I'm doing really the path I want to pursue? Is this the "right" thing to do, am I living a meaningful life? Protect those who are quality/class, ignore those who are mediocre, distance from those who harm.
	2. Default to neutral, until proven otherwise through actions or expressions. If the actions and expressions show an element of character/strength/clarity move towards protect/respect EVEN if I disagree with the premise. If a person is corrosive, move them towards distance.

The identity of a leader can be challenged, diminished, or renegotiated. We need to find a way to bring forth the **leader** identity.

***

# 2. Leader, Manager or Administrator?:

[[../Glossary#^Leader-def|Leaders]] within turbulent environments can be morphed or convinced to become managers or administrators. [The Quinn Mills (2005)](https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Principles_of_Management.html?id=237vAAAACAAJ&redir_esc=y)) the paper we are exploring here and his concepts.

[[../Glossary#^Admin-def|Administrators]] vary on the field/industry and organisations size. Smaller organisations use admins to acts as receptionists (Get appointments in order), secretaries (Get leaders/key figures in order), office managers (Get the office running in order), IT support (Ensure IT systems run smoothly and run according to policy/best practices), etc. Larger organisations use admins to collaborate with teams, oversee operations, and manage departments, etc.

[[../Glossary#^Manager-def|Managers]] make and execute plans. They assign what tasks need to be done, supervise people to ensure they are done, ensure money/resources aren't wasted, and resolve problems that arise. Managers are different from admins, as they provide the direction for the team rather than the infrastructure. Admins support the system, managers support the output.
## 2.1. Different Leadership Roles:
| **Role**           | **Core Functions**                                                                                                                                    |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Managers**       | Planning & budgeting • Setting direction • Organizing & staffing • Aligning people • Controlling • Problem solving • Executing tasks • Value creation |
| **Administrators** | Creating rules & regulations • Applying & interpreting policy • Record keeping • Form processing                                                      |
| **Leaders**        | Providing mission & vision • Communicating & inspiring buy-in • Motivating action • Problem solving • Adapting to change                              |
### 2.1.1. Case Study - Natalia:

> [!ABSTRACT] ## Case Study: Agency Leadership & Turnover
> 
> **Natalia**, an Eastern European director at a healthcare training agency, leads the department responsible for evaluating skill-building programs. While the agency is well-established, it is currently facing a **high staff turnover rate** (including three directors and an accountant) and increased market competition.
> 
> ### 👤 The Leadership Profile
> 
> - **Natalia:** Frequently travels and reports to senior leadership. She tends toward an **extreme "all-or-nothing" perspective**, focusing heavily on either the positive or negative.
>     
> - **The Dynamic:** She supervises two relatively new managers (appointed within the last 7 months), each overseeing six employees.
>     
> 
> ---
> 
> ### 👥 Management Breakdown
> 
> |**Manager**|**Background**|**Leadership Style**|**Current Status**|
> |---|---|---|---|
> |**Christine**|Organizational Training|Demanding, driven, and highly organized.|Valued by senior leadership for her expert knowledge.|
> |**Ivan**|Employee Training|Supportive problem-solver; highly organized.|Capable, but prone to overextending himself.|
> 
> ---
> 
> ### ⚠️ Critical Issues & Friction Points
> 
> - **Operational Stress:** Staff are overworked due to turnover and increased responsibilities.
>     
> - **Communication Climate:** Natalia’s "pessimistic conversation style" is reportedly dejecting the staff.
>     
> - **The Budget Bottleneck:** A breakdown between Natalia and the Finance Department has left a data gap. Without these budgets, Christine and Ivan cannot allocate work effectively.
>     
> 
> **Current Status:** The workforce is stressed, and management is frustrated by an inability to solve systemic problems.

### 1. What Role Does She Fulfil?:
Natalia is an **administrator.** She both lacks in managerial (Poor organisation and staffing, weak controlling, managers feel unable to solve problems) an leadership qualities (No inspiring vision, pessimistic demoralises staff, lack of stability, poor adaptation due to frequent travelling.) The main idea is that she is struggling and can process and report information upwards but fails to manage systems or lead people.

### 2. How Can She Use More Elements of Leadership?:

**Communication:**
*Replace extreme pessimism/optimism with transparent and balanced updates. Frame challenges as opportunities (High turnover means we can grow or rebuild internally), have regular presence despite travel (Video calls, check-ins) or renegotiate travel.*

**Vision:**
*Have a clear mission statement to navigate the transition period. Co-create a plan with Christine and Ivan, celebrate small wins to build momentum in hard times.*

**Empowerment:**
*Give Christine and Ivan decision making authority during her absences, shield them from unnecessary pessimism whilst keeping them informed on the more executive leadership. Recognise their ability to problem solve rather than bottlenecking the process.*

**Motivation via action:**
*Own the budget failure rather than blame game, demonstrate accountability, show investment in the team as people - not just the company.*

### 3. What Advice Would You Give Her?:

Don't manage upward as much, manage downwards and support your teams and people rather than supporting the top as much. Managers and staff are the foundation of the company and are required to be in good shape to function.

1. Stop blame game - own the failure and communicate with Christine and Ivan
2. Close the budget gap - work with finance and fix the problem at hand.
3. Change communication tone - Not emotional: replace doom with "this is the situation, here's our plan."


## 2.2. Which Role Do I Fit Into?:

![[../../../../03_Reference/Pictures/Pasted image 20260106105255.png]]

Currently, I spend most of my time in an administrative capacity - keeping things running smoothly, enabling others to do their work effectively, and ensuring the fundamentals are in place. 

I find satisfaction in this enabling work, but recognise that much of it remains invisible by design. To move toward where I want to be, I need to develop in three key areas: visibility, voice, and confidence. I want to be recognised not merely as someone who keeps things ticking over, but as someone with a clear philosophy about what makes teams effective - one grounded in doing the fundamentals well and building sustainable foundations rather than chasing dramatic transformation. 

The change isn't about becoming more directive or seeking authority, but about building the credibility and communication skills to have my perspective valued when decisions are being made. I aim to blend servant leadership - removing obstacles and enabling others - with stewardship of the organisation's long-term health. 

This means learning to articulate my ideas clearly, contributing meaningfully in group settings when I have genuine insight, and developing enough trust in my own judgement to advocate for a grounded, fundamentals-first approach even when others pursue riskier alternatives.

This sort of leadership style would likely perform in environments that are a higher risk or have a greater time horizon and would struggle in fast moving sectors that chasing quarterly profits. The Munger/Buffet approach is apt here - "simply don't lose money, or do anything stupid." The idea is that in response to turbulence and precarity is that you provide the stable ground for people to stand on.

***

# 3. Becoming an Inspiring Leader:

Where as block 1 introduced the idea of **Charismatic Leaders**. We're understanding that they use that approach through personality and unique appearances for others to follow them, we can apply this logic to inspiration.

## Activity 7 - Becoming an Inspiring Leader:

### 1. What Can People Do to Create an Inspiring Identity?:

The idea is that you as an inspiring leader want to:
- Make people feel heard and understood.
	- Build credibility and trust within people.
- Give meaning to the work (The "why").
	- Reveal or show the impact of work beyond that task that a person is doing.
- Set the direction and the course of the ship.
	- Develop a vision or idea and understand it deeply.
- Create a belief that the destination is worth working towards.
	- Articulate your vision clearly to other people, talk in a language they understand.
- Motivates action through incentives other than authority or money.
	- Give autonomy/freedom, mastery, purpose, belonging, recognition/pride, etc.
		- Different people have different values, so you'd want to tune it to the individual.
### 2. Role Model and Antithesis of Inspiring Leaders:

Personally, I think **Charlie Munger** is a good role model of an inspiring leader. He's stable and consistent and compounded growth over time rather than marching people towards a machine gun. His vision was "Invert, always invert" and about avoiding stupidity rather than chasing brilliance, which can work very well within an environment such as the stock market and financial markets, as they reward the analysis and understanding of risk - be it a high or low risk approach.

He also acted and treated other's in a simple and straightforward way, though the he could be very abrasive and dismissive sometimes as well. But he and Buffet cultivated success and chose great people to work at Berkshire Hathaway.

I'm against the mythology of grandiose start-ups and people who are visionaries. Yes, there are people who have an idea that has merit, but it also can enable toxic and destructive behaviours. Having a clear, well articulated vision is great and being inspirational is also great. But don't abuse that power.

**Elizabeth Homes** from Theranos is an example of inspiration gone wrong, she developed a vision and a followership, but instead of tackling the real problems at hand, she covered up the truth

## 3. What Makes an Inspiring Leadership Identity?:

Having a well-built and consistent moral framework that is built from experience and reality testing is key for inspiration within a leader. Then translating your core values into words that different audiences can understand. That way your "voice" comes from within and people can understand you.

For Munger, his values systems evolved from working 12 hour shifts in a greengrocer with Munger when he was a teenager, going and living through the great depression as well as his family, who ended up helping other and their community - They didn't try and extract as much wealth as possible, but acted with integrity and honesty. This in turn positively influenced his business ventures as he built connections and built positive habits.

For Homes, her vision of developing blood testing technology from a pinprick of blood for a wide range of tests was strong. But her value system was a façade, it was an inauthentic representation of Steve Jobs. She lied to the public and investors through pretending that the **Edison** machine worked. She knew that the technology wasn't there and couldn't work, this trickled down into other managers who either deceived or controlled employees with anger and fear.

Holmes's vision *was* inspirational - genuinely transformative if achieved. The failure wasn't ambition; it was honesty. She knew the Edison couldn't deliver and deployed it anyway. A good vision executed through lies isn't leadership, it's fraud. Inspiration requires both a compelling destination *and* truthfulness about where you actually are on the journey.

It's good to be inspirational like Homes, but you've also got to be honest, open minded and have integrity - like Munger, because otherwise your vision can turn to delusion.

## 4 & 5 & 6. Quizzes and Reflection:

I lean more towards models that focus on *consistency and integrity*, rather than through *warmth and emotional connection*. I'm likely to be more neutral and blunt about my vision, **I want people to buy-in to my idea, not into me as a person.**

Though, I'd need to ensure that my leadership is more visible, as the risk is that without the emotional flair or warmth, you end up being placed in managerial or administrative roles. You must be able to connect with others and inspire them, not through a misguided or toxic positivity, but by expressing my vision of integrity, stability, and order clearly and celebrating wins.

***

# 4. Managing the Impressions of Others:

As people, we build assumptions about others based on what we can or can't see. We can determine this from the way a person writes or talks, but appearances also matter an enormous amount - hence the existence of the "Halo Effect".

The idea is, that we have some control about others impression of us (word choice, language, tone of voice, how you frame situations, clothing, posture/body language, actions, etc), but we have characteristics we cannot change (Gender, age, nationality, race, accent, etc.)

Also, to add this point. Authenticity is important to an extent you can play the game of performance and acting differently to how you feel to benefit the situation. Do that long enough though, and it will hurt. Being fully strategic likely doesn't help, but being selectively strategic does.

**Translation is good, deception and performance eventually cracks.**

## Activity 8 - Impressions on Identity Building:

### 1. What Would colleagues/friends/family Say about Working with You?

Colleagues would describe me as reliable and task-oriented—someone who takes a practical, process-focused approach to work without unnecessary drama. I'm comfortable with structured environments but adaptable when situations require flexibility. People appreciate that I'm willing to tackle any task that needs doing and that I maintain a steady, professional demeanour.

I recognize that my measured communication style can sometimes be misread—I prioritize substance over enthusiasm, which means I may not always signal my engagement as obviously as others might. I'm also not naturally a "morning person," so I build in time to reach my optimal performance level. I focus on being dependable for others, even when that requires pushing beyond my personal comfort zone.

### 2. What Parts of Impressions can/can't You Control?

Certain demographic characteristics—age, gender, nationality, race—are inherent and outside my control. However, I have considerable agency over how I communicate and present myself professionally.

I adapt my communication approach based on context and audience: adjusting tone, language formality, body language, and what I choose to emphasize or omit. This adaptability is strategic, not superficial—it's about effective communication rather than pre-tense.

That said, my core professional standards are non-negotiable. I won't compromise on integrity—requests to cut corners, misrepresent facts, or manipulate situations would meet firm resistance. My flexibility extends to *how* I communicate, not to *what* I stand for.

### 3. Describe a time You Tried to Control an Impression of Yourself as a Leader.

During entrepreneurial business meetings, I consciously amplified certain authentic qualities to establish credibility as a business owner. I emphasized confidence in areas where I had genuine expertise while simultaneously positioning myself as an engaged learner—taking detailed notes and asking informed questions to demonstrate diligence and strategic thinking. I also maintained perfect attendance and arrived early, signalling respect for others' time and commitment to the venture.

These weren't fabricated traits but rather intentional emphasis of existing characteristics. I was genuinely committed to learning and prepared for meetings; I simply ensured these qualities were visible to stakeholders who needed confidence in my leadership capability.

The idea is that you need to internally prove to yourself that you are a leader, and show that out to the world and make others believe you're a suitable leader as well. It helps to evaluate the situation and act accordingly to be aware of your identity and impression of yourself and others.

## 4.1. Evaluating and Changing Your Leadership Identity:

Identity tends to shift over time - [Laker (2024)](https://www.forbes.com/sites/benjaminlaker/2024/07/15/how-your-leadership-identity-transforms-over-time/) explains that as we get feedback from the world that our approach changes, this is illustrated by Ashir's Story.

> [!ABSTRACT] Case Study - Ashir:
> In his workplace, Ashir used to put forward the identity of the boss with a sense of humour. He used to make jokes – many of them about himself – when he was usually using humour to get through difficult and tense moments. Ashir started to believe that the identity of the humorous boss he projected might have been holding him back, because his colleagues and staff didn’t see him as serious enough to advance. 
> 
> He started asking people in the office about how they saw him, about the identity they’d built for him, and he came to realise that, rather than seeing him as a boss with a sense of humour, they saw him as an office clown. 
> 
> This meant that there was a gap between Ashir’s perception of himself and that of his colleagues. Ashir was determined to close this gap and started controlling the things that he associated with his ‘clown’ identity: he stopped making jokes about himself, he started being more serious in meetings and he engaged in serious discussions. 
> 
> Soon afterwards, he noticed that his colleagues started coming to him for advice, asking him questions about how to handle particular situations or requesting guidance about how to manage difficult staff.

[Kane (2015)](https://web.archive.org/web/20160629044240/http://stillpointleadership.com/leadership-identity/) states that changing your identity takes three steps:
1. Be aware of what your identity currently is and how you built it.
2. Be willing got start acting in new ways
3. Take the time to embody these new habits in order to demonstrate to others that they represent a true shift.
### 1. How Do You Define Yourself as a Leader?

Shift focus from outward to inward. Start asking "How do I need to act in accordance for others?", the idea is that when others see a shift in behaviour there will be more 

Practice centring, have an upright posture, expand your awareness, and release tension. The idea is to be a little more mindful and aware. Self-regulate yourself and the actions that harm rather than hurt you.

Cultivate clarity and connection. Don't mince words, but cultivate both directness and empathy.
### 2. What Differences or Gaps Might there Be between Your Perception and Others?

This is illustrated through Roger:
- **Roger's perception**: He believed he was presenting ideas collaboratively and listening to his team.
- **Team's perception**: They experienced him as manipulative (using leading questions), not genuinely listening, and trying to "sell" them on pre-determined solutions.
- **The underlying gap**: Roger believed "his ideas were the best and that it was his job to get other people to buy into them" - but he wasn't conscious this belief was driving his behaviour.

We focus inward rather than outwards.

My perception is such:
- Alex's perception: Providing a stable presence, reliability, good listener.
- Team's perception: That I'm unhappy or dull and uninterested in what is happening.
- Underlying Gap: That my external presentation isn't matching what people typically expect or want.
### 3. How Could You Get More Information about Your Identity?

**Direct observation and feedback**: Roger worked with Kane as a coach who helped him examine his actual behaviours and their results, not just his intentions.

**Self-awareness through physical cues**: The exercise Kane describes (noticing bodily tension when recalling difficult situations) provides immediate information about your reactive patterns. Physical sensations reveal when you're triggered before conscious awareness catches up.

**Examining patterns of reactivity**: Kane encourages identifying your specific defensive patterns:
- Do you sugarcoat to avoid negative reactions?
- Do you become defensive and repeat your position?
- Do you abandon your position to smooth things over?

**Tracking outcomes**: Roger began noticing that "people thought that he was trying to sell them on his ideas because he actually was trying to sell them on his ideas" - the results he was generating provided information about his actual leadership identity.

### 4. What Could You Do to Change Your Leadership Identity?

Kane provides a practical framework:

**Shift focus from outward to inward**: Stop asking "How do I get them to behave differently?" and start asking "How do I need to be behaving differently?"

**Practice the centring technique**: The three-step physical process (upright posture, expanded awareness circle, softening tension) provides a concrete tool for managing reactivity in the moment.

**Develop self-regulation capacity**: Roger learned to "catch himself in the act" when he started convincing and cajoling, then pause and physically recentre before proceeding.

**Integrate both clarity and connection**: The goal isn't to choose between being direct or being empathetic, but to cultivate the capacity for both simultaneously. Roger's eventual success came from saying "here's where I stand on this, and what do you think?"

**Move from reactive to responsive**: By managing the automatic fight/flight/freeze response through physical centring, leaders can act skilfully rather than habitually.

## Roger Case Study:

### 1. What Happened to Roger:

Roger believed that he was presenting ideas collaboratively and listening to his team, where as his team thought that Roger was manipulative, used leading questions, didn't listen, and tried to sell them on pre-determined solutions.

The transformation occurred when Roger shifted from trying to manage his team to managing himself. He learned to recognize when he was slipping into his "convince and cajole" pattern, pause, re-centre himself physically, and then engage with both clarity about his position and genuine curiosity about others' perspectives.
### 2. Which Three Main Leadership Skills Was Roger Missing?

1. Taking clear positions
	1. Clearly define what expectations or positions that you have, so that other people don't have to guess or be lead into them.
2. Connecting with others
	1. Listen to your team's perspectives, if you ignore them and don't listen to them, they'll be very unlikely to listen to you. Authentic > performative connection.
3. Managing his own reactivity
	1. When you are under stress figure out what your leak is. See what the pattern is and take a step back before acting.

### 3. Re-examine the way You See Yourself as a Leader?

For me, what can be learned from Roger and Kane is:
1. Taking clear stands or positions is very useful, yet makes you vulnerable. Opening up once you've got a solid idea (Don't rationalise delays by conflating needing more time, with fear).
2. Focus on what you can control, how can you act to modify or change results and behaviour, rather than trying to modify other people directly.
	1. What can I do to get these results? VS How do I get my team to do what I want?
3. Figure out what happens when you are threatened.

# 5. Block Case Study:

**THIS RELATES TO THE TMA 01!**

> [!ABSTRACT] Case Study - Susan 1:
> 
> Susan runs the wealth-management division in a bank. Eight weeks after Susan took on this role, she was told that the Secure Value Fund (SVF) was not valid any more. 
> 
> Her team had made a mistake; whereas the SVF was a fund that was supposed to be low risk and maintain its value, her team had managed it in such a way that it had lost value. To make matters worse, the people who would suffer most from the mistakes her team had made were low-income earners who had invested in the fund as part of their retirement savings plans. 
> 
> These earners worked in a successful and established retail giant that was the biggest owner of these funds. Susan now has to decide whether or not the bank has to compensate the people who lost money.

## What Should Susan Do?

> [!DANGER] Option A
> 
> I need to take control of a very risky and difficult situation, and I can’t discuss this with the rest of the team before making a decision about whether or not to compensate the people who lost money by investing in this fund. 
> 
> Deciding not to offer compensation will bring disagreements and will make it even more difficult to implement my decision quickly, which is necessary. That’s bad news for the retail workers, but I’m sure their employer can compensate them for their losses. My staff will think I have no empathy or affection, but my loyalty is to the bank and its employees, so I get to choose what’s best for us.
> 
> If the situation is resolved, everyone gets to keep their jobs. I cannot risk people’s jobs! However, I’ll definitely look closely into how and why these mistakes were made so I can deal with those responsible.

>[!INFO] Option B
>
>This decision is much bigger than me. I’ve been working in the company for only eight weeks, and to be honest there’s no way for me to know what exactly happened or who is responsible for this mistake. 
>
>Although I have a few suggestions about how to deal with this issue, this is not the time to go asserting my authority. The situation is far too important to make a decision without discussing it first with the senior team. 
>
>The best thing for the bank is for the senior team to come together so we can agree collectively what’s the best way to handle the situation. It’s time to demonstrate to the team that I’m flexible and know when to step back and when to take control.

> [!SUCCESS] Option C
> 
> Although the bank doesn’t have a lot of money right now, the right thing to do is to put money in the fund in order to increase its value. However, when I announce this decision to the senior team, I might get fired. 
> 
> However, this decision agrees with my values, and I want to make my values clear to my employees and employers; they’re part of who I am. I may not be able to control all the things that affect the way others think of me, but this I **can** control. 
> 
> What’s done is done, and now is not the time to point fingers. Let’s see what we can learn from this mistake so we can make sure it won’t happen again.

## My Choice - Option C:

**The core issue is straightforward: the bank marketed the SVF as low-risk to low-income earners, the fund lost value due to management failures, and we must compensate.** This isn't primarily about values-signalling or moral heroism—it's about maintaining the fundamental contract between the institution and its investors, **which is the cornerstone of any financial institution.**

**Why Not Option A:**

Option A treats this as a choice between the bank's interests and customers' interests, but this is a false dichotomy. Refusing compensation creates three compounding problems:

1. **Reputational damage**: We explicitly promised low-risk protection to vulnerable investors and failed to deliver. Not compensating signals that our commitments are conditional—reliable only when convenient.
2. **Regulatory exposure**: Low-income retirement savings are often subject to fiduciary standards. Declining compensation invites scrutiny from auditors and regulators.
	1. Even if we technically avoid legal liability, the reputational damage from *"bank refuses to compensate low-income retirees"* is catastrophic. We'd spend more on crisis management than compensation would cost.
3. **Cultural corruption**: Most critically, Option A tells staff that when mistakes are expensive, we abandon our commitments. This creates moral hazard—if consequences can be externalized, why maintain rigorous standards? The long-term cost of this cultural message far exceeds the immediate compensation expense.
	1. A culture of ruthlessness, corner cutting, and exploitation is poison in the long-term.

The saving jobs framing is also suspect. It almost feels like rationalisation of harm. The greater threat to employment isn't compensation costs—it's the institutional damage from breaking trust with investors.

**Why Not Option B:**

Option B appears prudent—acknowledge your limited tenure, involve senior leadership, demonstrate flexibility. However, it mistakes a straightforward ethical question for a complex strategic decision requiring extensive deliberation.

The facts are clear: we promised stability, we failed to deliver, we restore losses. **The principle isn't negotiable; the implementation details are.** Option B's value lies in recognizing you need operational knowledge from the senior team about *how* to execute compensation efficiently—not *whether* to compensate.

Additionally, deferring this decision to "collective agreement" risks two problems:
- It allows the group to rationalize away the clear ethical obligation.
- It establishes a pattern where Susan abdicates leadership when situations become uncomfortable.

There's a distinction between **seeking input** (essential) and **deferring judgment** (abdication).

**Why Option C:**

Option C aligns with sustainable and inspirational leadership for several reasons:

1. **Honouring commitments**: The fund was marketed as low-risk. We failed that promise. Compensation isn't charitable—it's contractual obligation.
2. **Systems focus over blame**: "What's done is done" isn't dismissing accountability—it's recognizing that pointing fingers doesn't prevent recurrence. The priority is understanding process failures, not punishing individuals.
3. **Authentic leadership**: This decision makes clear what Susan stands for without requiring charisma or performance. Actions demonstrate values more credibly than declarations.
4. **Long-term institutional health**: We accept the immediate cost to prevent much larger future costs. More importantly, owning the mistake rather than deflecting it establishes a culture where people surface problems early rather than hiding them until they metastasize. Option A's culture produces cover-ups; Option C's culture produces transparency.

**Connecting to Leadership Development:**

This situation tests exactly the skills Kane emphasizes:
- **Taking a clear stand**: The compensation principle is non-negotiable, stated directly without sugar-coating
- **Staying connected**: Involving senior team in implementation (not the decision) maintains genuine collaboration
- **Managing reactivity**: Senior leadership may resist; Susan must stay centered while holding her position

The eight-week tenure is irrelevant to the ethical clarity required here, though it matters for implementation logistics. This is where Option B's collaborative instinct belongs—*after* the principle is established, not instead of it.

You could argue that the personal risk to Susan's position at the bank, not wanting to be fired, means that option B should be the path forward. I'd answer that by saying that you'll eventually transform yourself into a manager or an administrator and you feed into bureaucracy. If you can't make solid decisions and harbour risk and the organisation doesn't respect you for this, then it's their loss.

# Summary:

## Core Concept

Leadership identity is **fluid and context-dependent** - who you are as a leader shifts based on situation, audience, and environment. Effective leadership requires both a stable core of values and the flexibility to express them differently across contexts.

## Key Distinctions

**Three Organizational Roles:**
- **Administrator**: Implements rules, maintains systems, processes forms and records (infrastructure support)
- **Manager**: Plans, budgets, assigns tasks, supervises execution (directional support)
- **Leader**: Influences thinking, sets vision, inspires action, helps others see possibilities (transformational support)

## Critical Insights

**Identity is Co-Constructed:**
- Your self-perception alone is insufficient
- Others must also perceive you as a leader
- You have partial control through presentation (language, actions, framing)
- Some characteristics remain beyond your control (demographics)

**Inspiring Leadership Components:**
- Energizes people toward a compelling future vision
- Motivates through purpose beyond authority or money
- Embodies organizational values authentically
- Creates excitement about change rather than fear of it

## The Reconstruction Challenge

Leadership identity can be **deliberately changed** through three steps (Kane, 2015):
1. Awareness: Understand your current identity and how you built it
2. Action: Begin behaving in new ways aligned with desired identity
3. Embodiment: Sustain new habits long enough that others recognize genuine shift

**Warning**: Flexibility must not become performance. Translation of values across contexts is authentic; deception eventually cracks under pressure.

## Forward Connection

Week 8 explores how this identity flexibility enables inclusive leadership and supports diversity - recognizing that effective leadership adapts expression while maintaining integrity.

**Personal Application**: This week reinforced that your stewardship-focused, fundamentals-first approach *is* a valid leadership identity - it simply requires making that philosophy visible and articulating it clearly rather than assuming administrative competence equals leadership recognition.

# Reflection and Sharing:

- What have I learned this week that is particularly important or relevant?
- How could this inspire me to make a change in my professional or personal life?

**Week 7's key insight: leadership identity requires fluid translation, not performance.**  
  
The goal is expressing core values in forms different audiences understand - authentic adaptation, not a façade that eventually cracks.

I've realized my identity reads as "reliable administrator" rather than "leader." What's missing: visibility and voice. I excel at execution but don't articulate the *strategic reasoning* behind my decisions.

**The shift:** Frame my fundamentals-first approach explicitly as leadership philosophy, not administrative caution. When I advocate for sustainable processes over quick fixes, present it as long-term thinking/vision rather than executing silently and hoping others notice the quality.
