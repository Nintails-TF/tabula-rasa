# Introduction:

The main premise of the 2nd block is to figure out a leadership identity that is positive and resilient in the turbulent and precarious world/environments you are in. The most frequent problem is that when problems arise for whatever reason - having a stable leadership identity is more difficult to follow.

The main idea is to be an inspirational leader that others want to follow and listen to, and whilst I think that goal is noble, I'm more of the opinion that being a decent or mediocre leader first is ideal. I suppose it's a difference in approach - being decent first, then aiming for excellence second.
## Key Questions:

The key questions in this week 7 block are:
- What’s the difference between an [[../Glossary#^Admin-def|Administrator]], a [[../Glossary#^Manager-def|Manager]], and a leader?
- What’s your leadership identity and how can you influence it?
- How can you become an inspiring leader?

***

# 1. Constructing a Leadership Identity:

It's difficult to pin down your own identity and your own characteristics of yourself. You've got a personality, values, ideas, and will continue to evolve in the future as well. 

It's key since it dictates how you interact with others, what you prioritise, what others expect, and what you expect from others, and how your relationships operate.

 [[../Glossary#^Identity-def|Identity]] can be defined in various ways. Multiple disciplines such as political, social science, humanities, business studies, philosophy, psychology, have covered the idea of identity - each having their own angle and perspective, the more you learn the more you realise the deep layers and more material there is.

Another idea, is that **the actions you take bring you towards or further away from certain identities**. Studying brings you together with other university students on your course - as you work together and experience struggles/wins. Or more broadly students as a whole. But it also could bring you away from your family or work - as you choose to spend time studying rather than being with them.

It is always important to consider: **who do I want to be?**
## Activity 1 - Exploring Your Identity:

There are various quizzes or tests designed to categorise your identity. They can capture the broad strokes of a person, but not the fine details.

The identity quiz points towards **Conscientious:**

> *You know how to control yourself. This ability results in positive characteristics, such as reliability, thoroughness, and punctuality. You are a goal-achiever because you have the discipline and you keep working through obstacles. However, you can be a bit of a workaholic, so don't forget to have a little fun sometimes.*
> 
> *Even if your answers to this quiz have pointed out that you are open, conscientious or balanced, you have to keep in your mind that your identity is never definite, complete or stable. Under different circumstances, contexts or situations you may bring a different identity forward, you may provide different answers that emphasise a different identity or aspect of yourself.*
## 1.1. Identity Construction:

Our identity is built from various [[../Glossary#^identity-dimensions-def|Identity Dimensions]]. Constructing it is not easy, nor simple. 

## Activity 2 - Goldsmith's Identity Dimensions:

1. What is your dominant identity types?
	1. My identity is mostly remembered, programmed and in the process of being created.
2. Are you the person you want to be?
	1. I'm moving towards a place where I'm more happy with who I am, even now I don't hate myself, but there are things I would like to change.
3. How would you create a new identity?
	1. Figure out the conscious choices you can make and beliefs you can adopt or shed. I think you take on new identities by living or acting in different ways, showing up when you wouldn't normally or trying a new activity, looking at role models and people who you respect is also critical. 
	2. I'm the person who I am today because I initially tried to do everything right - be a kind person, generous, caring, and have a solid morality. Overtime since I moved away from my hometown in Shetland, my usual attitude was punished and ridiculed, which resulted in me withdrawing more from people. I've always followed and trusted authority - but again, I've been burned by that too.
	3. I'm more of a cynical person who's more aware of ulterior motives and I'm more adapt at reading between the lines. I still harbour a kindness for others and compassion, but it's guarded and only shown rarely to those who deserve it, the public are given the bare minimum.
	4. I've taken the approach of only worrying about or trying to control what I actually have power over, which isn't much, but gives me a path the follow and choices to make that move the needle towards a more disciplined, focussed, and solid version of me.

Examples like this can be referred to as [[../Glossary#^Identity-Construction-def|Identity Construction]]. Which has different perspectives both personally and academically. [Ashforth and Schinoff (2016)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/293025711_Identity_Under_Construction_How_Individuals_Come_to_Define_Themselves_in_Organizations) define identity construction as:

- The development of your values, beliefs, practices, discourses and knowledge.
- The shaping of yourself, usually through a strategic self-presentation that aims to enhance the positive idea that you have about yourself.
- Any effort to produce, maintain or recreate views about yourself.

Identities also change in reference to the environment too - For instance, when interacting with strangers my sister is very polite and clear, but when she's around friends and family - she is a lot more cheeky and loquacious.
## 1.2. Multiple Identities:

Your identity shifts depending on who you are talking to: Speaking to your Dad -> Son, Speaking to Classmate -> Pupil, Speaking at work -> Colleagues/Managers/Administrators/Leaders.

There are certain traits or things you would talk about with a friend whilst at the pub, and there is a way in which you would act at work or during a meeting. Since different audiences value and reward different behaviours.

You want to have a stable core or values, but to express them differently in changing environments, this means that your expression is real and isn't performative, which means people will actually believe and trust you more and you won't deal with psychological turbulence.

### Activity 3 - Exploring Multiple Identities:

I have the following identities:

1. Yin Alex - Family/Friends
	1. Be kind strategically—to those who've earned it, in ways that don't compromise my position, according to principles I've chosen rather than inherited
2. Yang Competitor Alex - Sports/Games
	1. Quietly beat people, assert that your better than them, show them your skills and abilities. Prove them wrong, respect opponents but give them no quarter, whilst smiling at their face. A great game requires a strong opponent, a weak opponent is boring.
3. Calculating Alex - Work/Education
	1. Find the most logical path through the situation, what's REALLY being said here, how can I optimise this or improve that? I don't care about externally weak morals or rules, what's the more efficient path here?
4. Philosopher Alex - When feeling unfulfilled or aimless
	1. Is what I'm doing really the path I want to pursue? Is this the "right" thing to do, am I living a meaningful life? Protect those who are quality/class, ignore those who are mediocre, distance from those who harm.
	2. Default to neutral, until proven otherwise through actions or expressions. If the actions and expressions show an element of character/strength/clarity move towards protect/respect EVEN if I disagree with the premise. If a person is corrosive, move them towards distance.

The identity of a leader can be challenged, diminished, or renegotiated. We need to find a way to bring forth the **leader** identity.

# 2. Leader, Manager or Administrator?:

Leaders within turbulent environments can be morphed or convinced to become managers or administrators. [The Quinn Mills (2005)](https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Principles_of_Management.html?id=237vAAAACAAJ&redir_esc=y)) the paper we are exploring here and his concepts.

[[../Glossary#^Admin-def|Administrators]] vary on the field/industry and organisations size. Smaller organisations use admins to acts as receptionists (Get appointments in order), secretaries (Get leaders/key figures in order), office managers (Get the office running in order), IT support (Ensure IT systems run smoothly and run according to policy/best practices), etc. Larger organisations use admins to collaborate with teams, oversee operations, and manage departments, etc.

[[../Glossary#^Manager-def|Managers]] make and execute plans. They assign what tasks need to be done, supervise people to ensure they are done, ensure money/resources aren't wasted, and resolve problems that arise. Managers are different from admins, as they provide the direction for the team rather than the infrastructure. Admins support the system, managers support the output.
## 2.1. Different Leadership Roles:
| **Role**           | **Core Functions**                                                                                                                                    |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Managers**       | Planning & budgeting • Setting direction • Organizing & staffing • Aligning people • Controlling • Problem solving • Executing tasks • Value creation |
| **Administrators** | Creating rules & regulations • Applying & interpreting policy • Record keeping • Form processing                                                      |
| **Leaders**        | Providing mission & vision • Communicating & inspiring buy-in • Motivating action • Problem solving • Adapting to change                              |
### 2.1.1. Case Study - Natalia:

> [!ABSTRACT] ## Case Study: Agency Leadership & Turnover
> 
> **Natalia**, an Eastern European director at a healthcare training agency, leads the department responsible for evaluating skill-building programs. While the agency is well-established, it is currently facing a **high staff turnover rate** (including three directors and an accountant) and increased market competition.
> 
> ### 👤 The Leadership Profile
> 
> - **Natalia:** Frequently travels and reports to senior leadership. She tends toward an **extreme "all-or-nothing" perspective**, focusing heavily on either the positive or negative.
>     
> - **The Dynamic:** She supervises two relatively new managers (appointed within the last 7 months), each overseeing six employees.
>     
> 
> ---
> 
> ### 👥 Management Breakdown
> 
> |**Manager**|**Background**|**Leadership Style**|**Current Status**|
> |---|---|---|---|
> |**Christine**|Organizational Training|Demanding, driven, and highly organized.|Valued by senior leadership for her expert knowledge.|
> |**Ivan**|Employee Training|Supportive problem-solver; highly organized.|Capable, but prone to overextending himself.|
> 
> ---
> 
> ### ⚠️ Critical Issues & Friction Points
> 
> - **Operational Stress:** Staff are overworked due to turnover and increased responsibilities.
>     
> - **Communication Climate:** Natalia’s "pessimistic conversation style" is reportedly dejecting the staff.
>     
> - **The Budget Bottleneck:** A breakdown between Natalia and the Finance Department has left a data gap. Without these budgets, Christine and Ivan cannot allocate work effectively.
>     
> 
> **Current Status:** The workforce is stressed, and management is frustrated by an inability to solve systemic problems.

### 1. What Role Does She Fulfil?:
Natalia is an **administrator.** She both lacks in managerial (Poor organisation and staffing, weak controlling, managers feel unable to solve problems) an leadership qualities (No inspiring vision, pessimistic demoralises staff, lack of stability, poor adaptation due to frequent travelling.) The main idea is that she is struggling and can process and report information upwards but fails to manage systems or lead people.

### 2. How Can She Use More Elements of Leadership?:

**Communication:**
*Replace extreme pessimism/optimism with transparent and balanced updates. Frame challenges as opportunities (High turnover means we can grow or rebuild internally), have regular presence despite travel (Video calls, check-ins) or renegotiate travel.*

**Vision:**
*Have a clear mission statement to navigate the transition period. Co-create a plan with Christine and Ivan, celebrate small wins to build momentum in hard times.*

**Empowerment:**
*Give Christine and Ivan decision making authority during her absences, shield them from unnecessary pessimism whilst keeping them informed on the more executive leadership. Recognise their ability to problem solve rather than bottlenecking the process.*

**Motivation via action:**
*Own the budget failure rather than blame game, demonstrate accountability, show investment in the team as people - not just the company.*

### 3. What Advice Would You Give Her?:

Don't manage upward as much, manage downwards and support your teams and people rather than supporting the top as much. Managers and staff are the foundation of the company and are required to be in good shape to function.

1. Stop blame game - own the failure and communicate with Christine and Ivan
2. Close the budget gap - work with finance and fix the problem at hand.
3. Change communication tone - Not emotional: replace doom with "this is the situation, here's our plan."


## 2.2. Which Role Do I Fit Into?:

I prefer administration mainly, I don't like telling people what to do, but I do like keeping things running smoothly and enabling people to perform or enabling my team/company to thrive. I'd prefer to be more inspiring and have people listen to me when I've got a meaningful take or idea. Thought I'd like to be a boring, solid, and stable leader rather than doing anything crazy or taking lots of risk - having a solid, plain, and grounded vision which can be executed upon. Which is administrator-like.
