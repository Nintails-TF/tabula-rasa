# Introduction:

The main premise of the 2nd block is to figure out a leadership identity that is positive and resilient in the turbulent and precarious world/environments you are in. The most frequent problem is that when problems arise for whatever reason - having a stable leadership identity is more difficult to follow.

The main idea is to be an inspirational leader that others want to follow and listen to, and whilst I think that goal is noble, I'm more of the opinion that being a decent or mediocre leader first is ideal. I suppose it's a difference in approach - being decent first, then aiming for excellence second.
## Key Questions:

The key questions in this week 7 block are:
- What’s the difference between an administrator, a manager, and a leader?
- What’s your leadership identity and how can you influence it?
- How can you become an inspiring leader?
