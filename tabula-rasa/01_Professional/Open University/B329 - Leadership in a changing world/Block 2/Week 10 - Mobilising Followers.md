# Introduction:

This week links two ideas: that leadership is fundamentally a [[../Glossary#^RL-def|relational activity]] — it happens _between_ people — and that we live in a world where leadership increasingly makes things happen through networks rather than hierarchy.

Rather than focusing on how people with position (leaders) mobilise those without position (followers), it requires considering how people both with and without position influence one another to lead a project, organisation or place.

## Key Themes:

- Understanding leadership and followership in a [[../Glossary#^NS-def|networked society]].
- Exploring [[../Glossary#^RL-def|Relational Leadership]] perspectives.
- Recognising [[../Glossary#^FCL-def|follower-centred]] approaches to leadership.
- Developing strategies to mobilise and influence others through relationships.

# 1. Leading and Following in a Networked Society:

The 21st-century world is increasingly described as "networked" — connected through trade, travel, and communications technology. Social media enables communication across continents in seconds, contributing to a flatter, less hierarchical world where knowledge is accessible and ordinary citizens' views are shared and examined.

In this connected world, political, business, and civil-society leaders cannot act without accounting for the views and influence of citizens and employees. Leading and following are therefore different in a [[../Glossary#^NS-def|networked society]] than in traditional hierarchical structures where positional leaders direct or command.

**Key characteristics of networked leadership:**
- Multi-directional processes of influence replace top-down command.
- Citizen groups, voluntary organisations, and service users influence how places develop and services are delivered.
- Businesses demonstrate responsiveness to stakeholder needs.
- Politicians are held accountable by campaigners and citizen advocates continuously, not just at elections.

The internet and social media have greatly increased the influence of individuals, campaigners, and businesses who actively manage their social-media presence — while reducing the influence of those without the resources or skills to do so.

**Critical caveat:** This networked world is far from ideal. The technological tools that connect people can mask coercion and promote powerful interests. Social media is both a mechanism for bottom-up social movements AND a powerful marketing tool for commercial interests. Hierarchy and privilege continue alongside networked relationships.

[Uhl-Bien et al. (2014)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1048984313001197) argue that researchers have written thousands of books on leadership yet paid little attention to followers. If we believe there can be no leadership without followers, we must attend to what followers do and how they contribute to creating leadership.

# 2. Leadership Through Relationships:

Leadership is inherently relational, taking place through social interactions between people with formal leadership roles and those without. [Gursoy et al. (2022)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0278431921002541) found that fostering strong leader-member relationships leads to increased follower commitment and performance.

### Activity 1 - Relational Leadership at Work (Emma Case Study):

The Emma case study illustrates several key points about relational leadership:

**Context:** Two team leaders (Ali and Akash) are competing for a senior management vacancy. Their rivalry has damaged collaboration — informal chats have decreased, and they've made clear that team members should not interact informally and all decisions must run through them.

**Who is leading?**
- Formally: Ali and Akash as team leaders, Karen as meeting chair.
- Informally: Emma is attempting to lead by building coalitions and preparing a well-researched proposal.
- The rotating chair position (Karen) was designed to develop leadership experience but now feels constrained by the competitive atmosphere.

**Key observations:**
1. Followers step up to lead when those in leadership positions are preoccupied or behave poorly.
2. Emma's strategy involves relationship-building (sharing thinking with Karen beforehand) and preparation (figures, costed proposals).
3. The deterioration of informal relationships between teams has damaged the collaborative environment.

This connects to [[../Glossary#^SI-def|Situational Leadership]] — leaders must adapt their technique according to each situation, including the importance of relationships within different contexts.

---

# 3. A Relational Perspective on Leadership of Place:

[[../Glossary#^PL-def|Place leadership]] research explores how a town, city, or locality is shaped by people and groups within and beyond that place. Traditional research focuses on political leadership and public administration — how decisions are made, how elected officials work with civil servants, how policies are created and implemented.

More recent studies explore how multiple players influence the priorities, projects, and identity of a place:
- Interest groups and activists
- Elected officials and public agencies
- Community and resident groups
- Businesses and retail networks
- Individual citizens

> "At the beginning of the twenty-first century, leaders at all levels … are concerned with the development of competitive, inclusive and sustainable places. The formal 'activities' of place-shaping – making, shaping and re-shaping the places where we live and work – can be highly complex and sometimes spontaneous and uncertain tasks." — Collinge et al. (2010, p. 368)

**How small organisations exert influence:**

Networks of small businesses, voluntary organisations, and concerned citizens — alongside public officials — can exert influence in a place. They make things happen by:
- Creating new projects
- Innovating and filling gaps in business and service provision
- Working in communities over long periods (unlike short-term policy initiatives)
- Engaging with citizens and understanding local needs
- Mobilising people to make a difference

### Activity 2 - The Influence of Small Voluntary Organisations:

The Lloyds Bank Foundation research (2016-18) explored small and medium-sized voluntary organisations (income £10,000 - £1 million) in local welfare services. Key finding: These organisations influence political leaders because they engage with citizens, understand local needs, and mobilise people — even when they struggle to access public funding due to austerity.

**Limitations to consider:**
- The influence of voluntary organisations and informal citizen groups may be small or very localised.
- Informal coalitions can mask differences within a community, promoting interests of those who "shout loudest."
- This relational understanding may seem more applicable to voluntary organisations than major businesses — though large international businesses increasingly recognise the value of relational approaches.

# 4. Leading the Relational Organisation:

As businesses develop internationally, they face challenges of operating across political, administrative, and cultural boundaries. To succeed, they must:

- Influence stakeholders with power and position
- Mobilise potential clients/consumers from different backgrounds
- Present themselves as listening organisations responsive to customer needs

**Example: Mishcon de Reya** — An international law firm with the strapline "It's business. But it's personal."

This represents a shift from faceless corporate entities to organisations that demonstrate they can meet individual needs. In a networked world, citizens use IT applications to discover how peers experience and rate services — businesses must respond relationally.

### Activity 3 - The International Law Firm:

Characteristics expected in leadership practice for a relational organisation might include: Encouraging, Inclusive, Engaged, Caring, Committed, Challenging.

**Connection to [[../Glossary#^SI-def|Situational Leadership]]:**
- Traditional hierarchies may work better with a **directing** leadership style (explicit directions, monitoring performance).
- A relational understanding calls for more **supportive** or **delegating** styles (valuing personal relationships, facilitating, encouraging, supporting team members).

---

# 5. Follower-Centred Leadership:

[[../Glossary#^FCL-def|Follower-centred approaches]] focus on the relationship between leaders and followers and the ways followers influence leaders. They highlight how the direction of an organisation is set not simply by those with position (managers/directors) but also by employees.

This understanding acknowledges that followers are **active shapers** of an organisation or society rather than passive recipients of pronouncements from senior positions. It positions followers as central to understanding how leadership happens and questions the clear divide between those who lead and those who follow.

### Activity 4 - Reading (Bligh, 2011):

**Extract 1 — Impact on leadership studies:**

Follower-centred perspectives move away from traditional conceptualisations to describe leadership as:
- **Distributed** — shared across multiple people
- **Contested** — subject to disagreement and challenge
- **Contradictory** — containing tensions and inconsistencies

Key insight: Followers have long shared leadership with those who have led. They can actively counteract destructive and toxic leaders by:
- Holding leaders accountable
- Creating term limits and departure options
- Exercising voting rights (literally and metaphorically)

**Extract 2 — Benefits of follower-centred approaches:**

Follower-centred approaches tackle "big issues": fundamentalism, extremism, dictatorship, corrupt governments, corporate abuses of power.

[Lipman-Blumen (2007, 2008)] describes followers' strong needs for leaders who keep them safe in uncertain situations and provide vision/direction, particularly in times of crisis.

**Two types of followers that support destructive leadership (Padilla et al., 2007):**

| Type           | Behaviour                                   | Motivation                                                                      |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Conformers** | Passively allow bad leaders to assume power | Unmet needs and immaturity make them vulnerable                                 |
| **Colluders**  | Actively support destructive leaders        | Want to promote themselves in an enterprise consistent with their own worldview |

> "Followers can evaporate a leader's mask of power merely by disbelieving in it…" — Bantu-Gomez (2004, p. 147)

# 6. How Does Influence Happen?:

A central idea of relational/follower-centred leadership is that leadership frequently happens through [[../Glossary#^MDI-def|multi-directional processes of influence]] rather than through commands. The influences that shape an organisation, project, or place come from multiple sources and interact through relationships.

### Activity 5 - Exploring Influence (Irina Case Study):

Irina's decision about leaving her job to become self-employed illustrates the web of influences:

|Influencer|Nature of Influence|Key Messages|
|---|---|---|
|**Family (husband, sons)**|Personal, emotional|Support but with conditions (school, commute, quality time)|
|**Directors**|Organisational authority|Value her, worried about survival without her|
|**Part-time staff team**|Peer/team|Dismissive ("we know you won't go"), relies on identity|
|**Carlos (financial adviser/friend)**|Expert and personal|Hard-headed analysis of potential and risks|

**Key observation:** Influence comes from multiple sources — authority figures, peers, experts, family — in different forms (emotional appeals, rational analysis, identity claims). The decision emerges from navigating these competing influences, not from a single directive.

# 7. Relational Leadership Strategies:

How can you influence, motivate, and mobilise other people, even when they appear more knowledgeable or powerful than you?

**Relational strategies:**

- Make time for relationship building
- Build deep networks over the long term
- Share something that matters to you — knowledge, resources, personal stories
- Be willing to receive from other people
- Listen to emotions as well as information
- Find out what matters to people and help them achieve it
- Hold others accountable and expect them to hold you accountable
- Ask (lots of) questions
- Resist toxic leadership
- Cultivate interdependency rather than dependency
- Listen with a careful but critical ear
- Vote — literally and metaphorically
- Challenge injustice and inequality

These connect to Week 9's collaborative leadership activities:

- Huxham and Vangen's (2005) spirit of collaboration: embracing, empowering, involving, mobilising
- Goman's (2011) emphasis on personal relationships and people-centred vision
- Chrislip's (2002) bringing together appropriate people and finding ways to relate

## 7.1. Limitations of Relational Leadership Strategies:

A relational perspective has definite attractions — it acknowledges that people without power can exert influence and highlights the need for supportive/delegating leadership styles.

**However, limitations exist:**

1. **Naive optimism** — The belief that positive relationships automatically lead to dispersed influence and better leadership isn't always true.
2. **Failed strategies** — Building relationships and working cooperatively can fail to achieve positive outcomes or motivate action.
3. **Dark side** — Relational approaches can become too cosy, manipulative, or nepotistic.
4. **Distraction** — Focus on nurturing relationships can divert attention from tough decision-making and determined direction-setting.
5. **Persistence of hierarchy** — Even when everyone relates well, decision-making can still be limited to those with position, and charismatic leaders can still persuade through rhetorical force rather than relational quality.

This challenges the view that 21st-century organisations are contexts where influence is networked rather than hierarchical.

# 8. Block Case Study:

**Case Study — Susan 4:**

Susan has been running the bank's wealth-management division for a year. Jordan, an internal candidate who lost the position to her, was recently unsuccessful in another internal promotion. His disappointment is affecting his work — arriving late, leaving early, not paying attention. At last week's meeting, he challenged Susan in front of colleagues about her Secure Value Fund decisions.

## What Should Susan Do?

> [!DANGER] Option A
> 
> Begin disciplinary procedures. Jordan challenged me publicly and was wrong. I need to ensure he respects my authority and that the team sees me reinforce it. A formal process will affirm my leadership and ensure the team works together rather than pulling in different directions.

> [!INFO] Option B
> 
> Ask Jordan to lunch to get to know him better — his home life, interests outside work. The bank encourages thinking of teams as networks rather than mini-hierarchies. If we get to know each other, we'll find a way to work constructively together.

> [!SUCCESS] Option C
> 
> Ask Jordan to meet and talk over my plan for next year. He has in-depth knowledge from 15 years' experience — I'll ask why he disagrees. Perhaps I've missed something. Discuss how Jordan and other experienced team members can contribute to important decisions — perhaps take on projects themselves. Ask how I can support him if he applies for promotion again. Perhaps start by telling Jordan about myself.

## My Choice - Option C:

**Option A** is problematic because:

- It escalates to formal procedures without first attempting relational engagement.
- It frames the situation as a power contest rather than exploring legitimate concerns.
- Jordan may have valid points about the Secure Value Fund that Susan missed.
- Disciplinary action for raising professional disagreement (even if poorly expressed) damages psychological safety.

**Option B** has good instincts about relationships but:

- Jumping straight to personal/social topics may feel intrusive or manipulative given the underlying professional tension.
- It doesn't address the substantive disagreement about the fund.
- "Getting to know each other" alone won't resolve the underlying issues of Jordan's thwarted ambition and potential legitimate concerns.

**Option C** works because:
- It acknowledges Jordan's expertise and experience (15 years) as valuable rather than threatening.
- It opens genuine dialogue about the substantive disagreement — maybe Susan DID miss something.
- It explores how to channel Jordan's capabilities constructively through meaningful involvement.
- Offering to support his future promotion attempts creates a forward-looking partnership.
- Starting by sharing about herself creates reciprocity and vulnerability.

This aligns with relational leadership principles: building genuine relationships, being willing to receive (knowledge, challenge), finding out what matters to people (promotion, recognition), and cultivating interdependency.

**The deeper issue:** Jordan's behaviour may be symptomatic of feeling undervalued and passed over. Option C addresses this root cause rather than just the symptom (poor meeting behaviour).

# Summary:

This week covered three main areas:

1. **Networked society and leadership** — In an interconnected world, leadership happens through multi-directional influence rather than hierarchy alone. Followers, citizens, and employees shape outcomes alongside positional leaders.
    
2. **Relational and follower-centred leadership** — Leadership is fundamentally relational, happening between people. Follower-centred approaches recognise followers as active shapers rather than passive recipients, questioning the clear divide between leaders and followers.
    
3. **Relational strategies and their limitations** — Multiple strategies exist for building influence through relationships, but relational approaches can fail, become manipulative, or distract from necessary tough decisions. Hierarchy persists alongside networks.
    

**Key points:**

- In a network society, influence works through relationships in addition to hierarchy.
- Followers influence leadership through relational networks but also by challenging, resisting, and voting to prevent toxic leadership.
- People with and without position mobilise others through relational engagement.

# Reflection and Sharing:

The relational leadership perspective offers a useful corrective to heroic, individual-focused leadership models. It recognises that influence flows in multiple directions and that "followers" actively shape outcomes.

However, I remain somewhat skeptical of how this plays out in practice. The material acknowledges limitations but perhaps understates how persistent hierarchy really is. The Mishcon de Reya example — "It's business. But it's personal" — could equally be read as sophisticated marketing rather than genuine relational practice. The strapline itself is revealing: business comes first, personal is the qualifier.

The follower typology (conformers vs colluders) is useful for understanding how bad leadership persists. But it raises uncomfortable questions: Are there situations where "conforming" is rational self-preservation rather than moral failure? The material doesn't fully grapple with power asymmetries that make "resistance" costly.

The Susan case study illustrates the tension well. Option C is clearly "correct" by the module's framework, but in practice, whether it works depends entirely on Jordan's response and the organisational context. If Jordan interprets openness as weakness, Option C could backfire. Real relational leadership requires reading situations — which brings us back to [[../Glossary#^SI-def|Situational Leadership]].
