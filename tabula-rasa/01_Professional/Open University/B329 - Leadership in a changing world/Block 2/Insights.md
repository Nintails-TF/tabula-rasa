# Week 7:

**Should everyone even lead?** - a person may be capable to lead, but it might not be sustainable for them. You can say that anyone CAN lead - I agree, but does anyone WANT to lead or is it healthy for them - I disagree.

Leadership is a trade-off:

**Costs:**
- Higher stress and responsibility.
- Accountability for others' failures.
- Constant decision-making under uncertainty.
- Visibility = exposure to criticism.
- Work-life boundary erosion.
- Emotional labour of managing team dynamics.

**Benefits:**
- Recognition and status.
- Material resources (salary, perks).
- Autonomy and control over work.
- Influence and impact.
- Access to information and networks.

The worse situation to be in, would be to be treated like a leader with non of the benefits.

Different Personalities weight leadership differently:
- **High Neuroticism person:** The stress costs might massively outweigh the autonomy benefits - they're trading psychological wellbeing for resources they might then spend on managing the anxiety the role creates
- **High Extraversion person:** The recognition and social influence might actually _reduce_ their stress (energizing rather than draining), making the trade highly favourable
- **Low Openness person:** The constant ambiguity and change inherent in leadership might be more costly than the autonomy is valuable

This means that the benefits must be higher for them to take the plunge, it also means that certain people are incompatible with leadership as they'd be hurt, damaged, or corrupted by it.

But when career advancement or benefits are locked behind leadership, you have perverse incentives where:
- People who would be healthier and happier as expert contributors feel forced into leadership for resources/autonomy
- Organizations lose excellent individual contributors who become mediocre, stressed leaders
- Leadership becomes about personal advancement rather than genuine fit for the role

You run into two problems:
1. People don't want leadership since the cost benefit isn't high enough, the cost is too high, stress too high, technical or specialist work is more rewarding and better paid
	1. People in order to progress join leadership who are unwilling
	2. Reluctant leaders create poor culture -> reinforced pipeline -> vicious cycle.
	3. **Typically within:** Public sector, academia, highly technical fields
2. People want leadership too much since leaders are rewarded disproportionally to non-leaders, other paths have limited resources or recognition, or the organisation has "Up or Out" culture.
	1. People politically manoeuvre for positions
	2. People who should be following are trying to be leaders
	3. Actual work suffers because everyone is self-promoting
	4. High performers leave because they don't want to deal with the optics.
	5. **Typically within:** Corporate hierarchies, finance, consulting.

Cybersecurity has both: 
1. Leadership Vacuum - Operational/Technical leadership
	1. Extreme accountability - every breach gets criticised, when things work = no praise
	2. High burnout
		1. CISOs get thrown under the bus for anything wrong.
	3. Not maintaining own technical skills prevents growth and obsoletes your own skills
	4. Asked to do more with less

You get leaders who leave within 18-24 months, technical experts who refuse management roles, reluctant leaders who'd rather be doing technical work.

2. Leadership Glut - Strategic/Executive leadership Glut
	1. C-suit visibility: CISO is board level within orgs
	2. CISOs have big salaries
	3. Amazing credentials
	4. High-consulting rates.

You get leaders who have good management credentials but don't understand cybersecurity or technical depth. The process can be security theatre (Uninformed decision making, lack of respect from technical team, understand what they are defending.)

C-suite wants people who talk business/finance, over someone who uses technical reality or terms. it's hard to evaluate technical depth and the role is already 80% politics which selects for politics.

**Is leadership development just about people improve their ability to play with politics and perceptions?**
