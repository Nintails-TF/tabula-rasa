# Leadership Challenge

**Group 3:**
- Alexander Glen - Responsive!
- Lauren Hayes - Responsive!
- Matthew Hudson - Responsive
- Daria Korwel - Responsive! (Left today, assume she's working on her own)
- Keith Lilley - Ill and bit behind - work on own.

The use of freshwater resources, within AI resources for cooling - the water becomes increased with cadmium - this water cannot be reused. Noise pollution is also a big problem.

Water would be getting more expensive, and drinking water could be a shortage. Filtering out cadmium is costly and is challenging.

Different contaminants counteract each other, but this can cause different problems with thyroid problems. Fish is the best source for this, but fish iodine sources are going down.

Unknown contaminants occur, because you need to gather evidence.

Access and affordability are the big problem with stopping greenhouse gas emissions. Offer alternatives in a smarter way. Make things cheaper to do.

## Meeting 1:

### Meeting Prep:

**Claire Blanchard:** If you are doing the Leadership Challenge on your own it is imperative that you not only inform your team members but also myself. By Friday 30th January can you please let me know the title/broad area of your  Leadership Challenge together with a definitive list of who is in your team.

Laruen: Works for quality control in a small sided packing plant or organisation.

Daria left the group chat at 9:36AM Today.

# Meeting Notes

## Remote Working:

Do something that relates to working conditions within people. Returning to the office, remote working conditions? Lord Alan Sugar - will people want to return to the office.

Tension between companies and people wanting to return, versus corporations. Hybrid working agreements.

Post-COVID work remoting. 

1. The role of leadership in tackling the challenge must be clearly identified.
2. The challenge addresses an important issue in business and wider society
3. The challenge can be seen as "wicked problem" that would benefit from leadership approaches such as: "Place-based, resistance leadership, activist leadership, leadership for social change."
	1. Wicked Challenges
		1. Social - Could result in wealth inequality
	2. Tame Challenges
		1. May be complex but could of been solved before.

CTA: Call to action would be to treat people and find a middle ground, not for one-side to dominate the other, not employers to enforce workers to do x, y, and z. Leaders act as negotiators and facilitators to bring the best out of employee's

## Cybercrime:

Cybersecurity and cybercrime is a strong angle. Talk about this as a sort angle.

NHS 2017 WannaCry, how big organisations especially in the Government, Healthcare, cannot defend themselves.

Misinformation, election fraud, deep-fakes, defamation.

Cyber Crime as our main issue, there are a few different angles:

1. Government or Healthcare organisations cannot afford to protect themselves.
	1. **Talent Shortages** - Overstated issue, it's more about where graduates/seniors end up.
	2. **Pay disparity** - Most people aren't working for £45k at the NHS with limited resources, progression, and support. They'd rather work at a Bank for £80-£120k where they get more respect, progression, and compensation.
		1. Biggest problem from my POV - coming from an individual in cybersecurity.
		2. There will be a few who do it out of the good of their heart, but not enough.
	3. **Justifying it to leadership:** Security spending is invisible when it works. You ask for money to prevent something that **might** happen. Whereas, hospitals need every scrap of money they need for beds, staff, services.
		1. You run into the problem where organisations weigh the risk of being hacked against the cost of prevention. This isn't how security should work, but it's often how institutional decision-making operates under resource constraints.
	4. CTA could be something like:
		1. Leaders in government and healthcare must stop treating cybersecurity as an IT problem and recognise it as an organisational survival issue. 
		2. This means advocating internally for security investment with the same urgency as frontline services, challenging funding structures that make public sector roles uncompetitive, and building coalitions across institutions to share resources and expertise that no single organisation can afford alone.
			1. One bad cyberattack can tarnish your organisation, in essence.
	5. Leadership style is more **resistance leadership** - you push back on the status quo and the current culture within healthcare/government because the cost of failure is severe.
		1. Any government or healthcare organisation will tell you: "We can't do this, it's too expensive."
		2. Things like phishing training do work, but if your organisation and system is configured that one phishing link compromises your whole organisation. It's bad security and architecture.
			1. Both individuals should do training, but organisations also need to level up security as well. Rather than blaming on human error, which is tempting.
			2. You'd have to refute this and demand that real change and accountability is made.
				1. This shows how the problem is more wicked in nature, you can't just train employee's better, the reality is more complicated then that.
### Case Studies or Examples:

**The Vastaamo Case (2020):** A Finnish psychotherapy provider suffered a data breach exposing therapy notes of approximately 33,000 patients. The attacker demanded ransoms from individual patients, threatening to publish their most intimate disclosures. Multiple victims took their own lives. This wasn't an isolated incident, it represents a pattern where institutions entrusted with our most sensitive information fail catastrophically.

(One of my favourite podcasts did an report on this! [Vastaamo – Darknet Diaries](https://darknetdiaries.com/transcript/159/))

**NHS WannaCry Attack (2017):** The ransomware attack crippled one-third of NHS trusts across England, forcing hospitals to divert ambulances, cancel approximately 19,000 appointments and operations, and revert to pen and paper. Staff couldn't access patient records, test results, or medication histories. The attack exploited known vulnerabilities in outdated Windows XP systems that hadn't been patched - despite warnings. Total cost exceeded £92 million, but the real toll was measured in delayed cancer treatments and disrupted emergency care.

(Darknet diaries also did one on the NHS too: [WannaCry – Darknet Diaries](https://darknetdiaries.com/episode/73/))

**US Office of Personnel Management Breach (2015):** Attackers, believed to be state-sponsored, exfiltrated the personal records of 22.1 million current and former federal employees, including 5.6 million fingerprint records and detailed security clearance background investigations. These files contained mental health histories, financial troubles, family information, and foreign contacts. Precisely the information needed to blackmail, recruit, or compromise intelligence personnel. The breach potentially damaged US national security for a generation, and many affected individuals will never know how their data has been used.

## Plan Going Forward:

Go to tutorials and ask for ideas, tutorial dates:
- **27th Jan, Tuesday @ 4PM**

- 29th Jan, Thursday @ 6:30PM
