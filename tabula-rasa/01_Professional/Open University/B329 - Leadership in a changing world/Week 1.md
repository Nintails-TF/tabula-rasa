# Block 1: Leadership in Turbulent Times:


The key skill in the first block is critically thinking about turbulence, precarity, populism, and multi-culturalism.

- **Week 1:** Turbulence and technological changes, the role of social media in building and mediating leadership.
- **Week 2:** Precarity how it effects others, how to lead in organisations with precarity. 
- **Week 3:** The rise of populism, what populism is and what is the relationship between a populist leader and a charismatic leader is.
- **Week 4:** Multi-culturalism and it's implication on leadership, how different cultures prefer leadership.

## Introduction:

We define leadership as: 

> *A collection of concepts concerned with how meaningful direction is generated, offered, accepted and resisted within and across groups and organisations.*

There are three key words to remember about leadership:
1. **Meaningful**
	1. *Sense making - you need to build an emotional commitment with others.*
2. **Direction**
	1. *Sense giving - you need to give people a direction of where to go and what to do.*
3. **Followership**
	1. *Other people in an organisation that are inspired or influence to follow values or someone.*

### Key Questions:

- What do we mean by leadership and turbulence, and which theory can help to understand and explain leadership in turbulent times?
- Why is it important to think critically about some of the phenomena occurring in our changing world?
- Why are social networks important for contemporary leadership?

*Answer in due time.*

# 1. What is Turbulence:

We define turbulence as:

> **Situations where events, demands, and support change at a highly variable, inconsistent, unexpected and unpredictable ways.**

Turbulence is usually used to describe weather or currents, within the area of organisations and leadership, we can denote two different forms:

1. **External turbulence**
	- *Factors outside your organisation or group. So certain fields of study or work, geographic locations have more/less external turbulence and uncertainty.*
	- *Including but not limited to: legal rulings, accidents, technology advancements, wars, protests, or partisan conflict*
2. **Internal turbulence**
	- *Factors within your organisation or group.*
	- *Including: factional conflict, staff turnover, conflicting rules, internal reform, or complex structures. **(Ansell and Trondal, 2018)***

In modernity, it could be argued that turbulence is not limited to a single crisis or event. But is consistently enduring and existing within business, politics, and society. You have 4 main factors that support this claim:

1. **International real-world events**
	- Globalisation, technological changes, political moves such as Russo-Ukraine war, The Isreal-Palastine situation, and Brexit.
2. **The changing character of politics**
	- News and information has become more polarised and versatile. Social media streams accelerate both trust gain and loss.
3. **The nature of public problems**
	- Climate change, economic inequalities.
4. **Organisational and institutional complexity**
	- Supply chains are longer and stakeholder networks are more complex.

The question is: ***How does this change leadership?***

## 1.1. Effects of Turbulence on Leadership:

### Activity One - Looking at the Four Factors of Turbulence:

I chose to talk about OpenAI or Generative Ai in general and it's challenges:

# 2. Complexity Leadership Theory:

Uncertainty and turbulence creates complex challenges, we can use complex leadership theory to address challenges. 

Leadership is not just the act of one leader making decisions to solve a problem, but it is a network of numerous forces within a system, with varying levels of power and authority making decisions to reach a goal.

For example: *Plastic pollution: It isn't up to one singular figure to change this. (e.g. changing our habits, government enforcing environment-friendly decisions, key stakeholders taking action, etc.)*

Complexity leadership theory recognises different types and styles of leadership that coexist together. So organisations have forms of alignments, control, and hierarchy - but conditions such as creativity, problem-solving and learning allow leadership to adapt to the changing needs of the organisation.

The success of people and corporations, isn't always in what they have, but in their reputation, image, and product or service. With technology, assets are become digitised rather than physical assets like buildings, goods, ingredients.

The core good in the modern economy is knowledge and information - then acting upon that knowledge and information (innovation).

*(Uhl-Bien, Marion and McKelvey, 2007.)*

## Activity 2 - Real Word Examples of Complex Leadership Theory:

**Q:** *Considering what you have read in this section about complexity leadership, try to think of an example of a corporation whose success lies more in its social assets than its physical assets. For example, consider the way a business manages its relationships and reputation with its clients. You may want to use an internet search to help you.*

**A:** The key concept which makes social assets more valuable is the fact that networks and reputations are more visible in our modern era - companies that have connect people together and/or are trusted in what they do.

So consulting, auditing, and law. Require strong reputations, people trust them with big serious problems - McKinsey, Deloitte, etc.

Technology platforms like Meta, LinkedIn, Airbnb, Uber connect people together and provide a useful platform for people.

Credit ratings such as Moody's or the S&P global comes from their reputation and evaluation of markets.

Visa, Mastercard and PayPal are trusted middlemen that work in the payment processing sphere.

*Could expand upon this later*

# 3. The Practice of Adaptive Leadership:

Adaptive leadership refers to a style in which members of an organisations, community adapt to change, the idea is that an adaptive leader should learn from their experiences and apply insight into different contexts.

They look at the situations, facts, and evidence rather than letting ego do the talking. Figure out what problems are technical or adaptive (e.g. fix broken code vs changing behaviour). It's tougher to change behaviour, since you are forcing people to change.

> Adaptive changes are hard, because they can divide and pit people against each other, whilst a technical problem has a common goal. - **a bug doesn't care if you attack it, people do.**

McKinsey succeeds because leaders can make painful decisions by using the consultants as scapegoat - If they fail, blame McKinsey or individual consultants. If they win, celebrate leadership for bringing in the right people. e.g. Give leaders plausible deniability and political cover

Understanding that leadership is a strength built from continuous learning, most people can become good leaders with practice.

### Technical Skill VS Leadership Capability:

The paradox is that for people to get into leadership positions, they either have to be prior leaders or rise in an organisation through develop technical skills or tertiary skills that aren't related to leadership.

People can be great at what they do, but terrible leaders - it's difficult to justify a bad leader around, when money and productivity is being burned. Perhaps the middle path is for technical greatness to practice leadership in safe spaces first - either inside or outside the workforce.

Working in informal settings, is harder than formal settings, as you can't use rank - you need to manage emotional conflicts without formal power - you need indirect power or moves.

An adaptive leader can rally their staff to address changes and challenges to live with a new situation that people may be reluctant to accept. *(ANSZOG, 2017).*

## 3.1 Principles for Leading Adaptive Work:

![[../../../03_Reference/Pictures/adaptive-work-cycle.png]]

1. Getting on the balcony
	1. Not viewing the game as a player, but from a birds eye. Look at factors that are changing.
2. Identifying the adaptive challenge
	1. What are the big problems? What realities are not being faced? Can we make this a Technical problem or do we NEED to change our organisation?
	2. Be careful to not pretend something is technical when it is adaptive.
3. Regulating distress
	1. Leaders have to get people ready to change, the workers cannot expect executives to take the problem off their shoulders.
4. Maintaining disciplined attention
	1. Individuals, groups, cultures are often locked in their own ways of seeing and acting, changing is tough and people can avoid it. So it must be ensured that people do actually change and to settle conflicts in a productive way.
	2. Delay, denial, distraction, deflection are all common.
5. Giving work back to the people
	1. Having a mindset of taking responsibility about problems, means that people own the problems and leadership doesn't take responsibility from those who can make change.
	2. Don't solve for people, create conditions where others can solve it.
6. Protecting voices of leadership from below
	1. Don't ignore people lower down in the chain, they are often emotional as well, criticism of the work you do, doesn't mean you are being attacked. Look at what people are saying no matter who they are and judge it on its merits, even if it sucks or is amazing.
	2. Juniors telling seniors that they are see an issue with their work.

### Arguments against Adaptive Leadership:
Sometimes due to the structure of environments - adaptive leadership doesn't matter:

**High-turnover, low-skill environments:**
- Amazon warehouse: Doesn't matter if workers hate it, there's always more
- Doordash drivers: App-mediated, no relationships, pure transaction
- Christmas retail: Gone in 6 weeks, why invest in their development?

**Extract-and-exit executives:**
- Private equity playbook: Slash costs, boost short-term numbers, sell before it implodes
- CEO with 3-year golden parachute: Maximize stock price, cash out, next person's problem

Social assets which depend on reputation cannot use this model obviously. **But adaptive leadership only applies when a person isn't easily replacable.** 

Low skill + High kill vs High skill + low kill.

Most real world environments are hybrid. Leadership is sometimes Transactional like amazon or Adaptive like McKinsey. Now, Algorithms monitor and manage people rather than humans, with a small amount of human intervention.

*System design and process management are also important pieces of the leadership story. Since they scale and save money.*

### Activity 3 - Experiencing Adaptive Work:

**Q:** Identify a challenge within your own work or personal life. Which of the six principles of adaptive work could you apply to this situation? Write up to 150 words explaining how you could use one or more of these principles to respond to your own challenge.

**A:** *Challenge: Final university degree - building cybersecurity career as well.*

*Getting on the balcony: This isn't really a time management problem. It's about choosing what to sacrifice. Good grades, practical skills, and connections all compete for time - optimizing one means the others suffer. I need to see the trade-offs clearly rather than pretending I can do it all.*

*Regulating distress: Breaking it into phases instead of burning out trying to perfect everything simultaneously. Coursework comes first to finish the degree, then shift focus to portfolio projects and professional network. Too much pressure and I'll collapse; too little and nothing gets done.*

*Giving work back to myself: No one's going to create the perfect path for me. The university gives me a degree, but building marketable skills and reputation is on me. I own this problem and need to make strategic choices about where my effort goes.*

# 4. Critical Thinking:

To think critically means to: *"Examine ideas, evaluate them against what you already know and make decisions based on their merit."* 

Within B329, this definition also applies: *"A complex process of deliberation which involves a wide range of skills and attitudes."*

## Critical Thinking Steps
1. **Formulate your question** — Clearly define what you want to understand or solve.  
2. **Gather information** — Collect facts, evidence, and context from reliable sources.  
3. **Apply information** — Use what you’ve learned to analyse or address the question.  
4. **Consider implications** — Think about the outcomes or consequences of your conclusions.  
5. **Explore other viewpoints** — Look at different perspectives to challenge your assumptions and refine your understanding.

## 4.1 Thinking Critically about Disruptive Technologies:

Definition: *"A piece of disruptive technology is any enhanced or new tech that replaces and disrupts an existing technology making it obsolete. It is designed to succeed similar tech already in use."*

A few example include:
![[../../../03_Reference/Pictures/hexes-of-disruptive-tech.png]]

Disruptive tech also changes the systems that are in place within businesses and how work is done, creative adaptive problems in which people need to change with the new technology and systems in place.

# 5 Leadership and Social Networks:

Social media has been both a positive and a negative for leadership, social networks prefer charismatic and demagogue leaders - who persuade using wit and appealing to emotion rather than logical argument.

Social media - if you like it or not - is a powerful 21st century tool in building connections, cultivating leadership, and collecting data on thoughts.

Social media as a few main features for leaders:
- Regularly updating your mask and letting others know where you stand on topics.
- Fostering a positive impression of the self to others.
- Building business and professional connections.

Different social media platforms have advantages and disadvantages.
- Linked-in being the main set for companies and business connections.
- Twitter being an easy way to express opinions or details.

Social media isn't useless, but must be used with an express purpose in mind. Mainly because direction and followership are directed through these means.
