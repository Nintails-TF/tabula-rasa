# Block 2:

## Week 7:
- Leader
	- A leader is a person who decides the vision and goals of what an organisation is to achieve and inspires others to take action. ^Leader-def
- Administrator
	- Administrators apply rules and regulations that are developed by the organisations leadership. ^Admin-def
	- Typically they keep records, fill out forms, and keep the gears of communication running smoothly.
- Manager
	- Managers make plans and execute plans across various domains (Human, financial, material) to fulfil the goals of the leadership. ^Manager-def
	- So producing budgets and explaining what resources or skills are needed to achieved the targets of the organisation and managing deadlines.
- Identity
	- Identity refers to how individuals and groups define themselves internally (through beliefs, values, characteristics) and how they are defined by and relate to others externally (through social roles, cultural markers, group memberships). ^Identity-def
	- It encompasses both self-perception and social recognition, operating at individual and collective levels across multiple dimensions including race, ethnicity, religion, language, and culture.
- Identity Dimensions
	- Identity dimensions refers to four main dimensions: Remembered, Reflected, Programmed, Created. ^identity-dimensions-def
		- **Remembered Identity**: Our personal memories of past experiences (e.g., "I'm a bad tennis player because I remember losing matches")
		- **Reflected Identity**: How others tell us about our past ("I'm a bad listener because someone told me I was")
		- **Programmed Identity**: Beliefs others instill in us, often from childhood (Goldsmith's example: his mother programming him to believe he had no mechanical skills, which he accepted until age 28)
		- **Created Identity**: The identity we actively choose to create for ourselves
- Identity Construction
	- The shaping of yourself, usually through a strategic self presentation that aims to enhance positive ideas that you have about yourself. Otherwise, any effort to produce, maintain or recreate views about yourself. ^Identity-Construction-def
- Inspiring Leadership 
	- Energising and creating a sense of direction and purpose for employees and excitement and momentum for change where needed. It involves energising individuals to do their best in order to achieve a compelling vision of the future by embracing and following the organisation's values in all aspects of their work. ^Inspiring-Leadership-def
		- Personally, I more believe the following:
			- Creating conditions where people find meaning in their work, feel heard and trusted, and can contribute their best thinking. It involves providing clarity about direction while remaining open to challenge, removing obstacles, and building sustainable foundations that allow people to thrive without constant external motivation.
			- This means that you can cultivate a system that works and functions that doesn't require anything dramatic or speeches to happen.


## Week 8:

- Inclusiveness - Making the most of diversity in staff and people. Inclusion increases the depth and range of behaviours, capabilities and skills that an organisation, a society or a team can use. ^Inclusiveness-def
- Diversity - Any dimension that can be used to differentiate groups and people from one another. It is about empowering people by respecting and appreciating what makes them different. ^Diversity-def
- Boundaryless Leadership - Refers to leading across traditional divides and barriers - bringing together diverse individuals, groups, or organizations that might normally be separated by differences. ^BL-def
- Global Inclusion - Is when you broaden what "inclusion" covers beyond traditional categories (race, gender) to include any dimension where valuable perspectives get systematically overlooked—function, generation, geography, seniority, technical vs. non-technical background. ^GI-def
	- It's understanding the idea that the barriers shift depending on the organisation and their personal blind spots.
- Situational leadership - Is a leadership style developed by Blanchard, Patricia,, and Zigarmi (1985). It refers to the need for a leader to adjust their leadership style to different situations and different levels of staff experiences and characteristics. ^SI-def
	- According to this model, the leader adapts to the existing work environment and the needs of a particular community, organisation or task that they lead by moving between a coaching, supporting, directing or delegating leadership style.

## Week 9:

- Collaboration - The action of working with someone to produce something. ^Collaboration-def
	- Working in this sense can mean a myriad of different things, from talking and problem solving to physically completing a task.
- Collaborative Leadership - Collaborative leadership is a style practised by leaders who recognise the importance of interpersonal relationships and cross functional collaborations for organisational success. ^CL-def

## Week 10:

- Relational Leadership - A set of interrelated ideas that focus on leadership as fundamentally occurring through relationships and social interactions between people, rather than residing in individual leaders. It emphasises the connections between people with and without formal positions, viewing leadership as distributed, contested, and emerging from interactions. ^RL-def
- Networked Society - A description of the 21st-century world characterised by connectivity through trade, travel, and communications technology. In networked societies, knowledge is accessible, influence is multi-directional, and leadership increasingly happens through networks rather than hierarchy alone. ^NS-def
- Follower-Centred Leadership - An approach to leadership studies that focuses on the relationship between leaders and followers and the ways followers influence leaders. It positions followers as active shapers of organisations and society rather than passive recipients, questioning the clear divide between those who lead and those who follow. ^FCL-def
- Place Leadership - Research and practice exploring how a town, city, or locality is shaped by multiple players within and beyond that place, including interest groups, activists, elected officials, public agencies, community groups, businesses, and individual citizens. ^PL-def
- Multi-Directional Influence - A characteristic of networked organisations and societies where influence flows in multiple directions between people with and without position, rather than only top-down from positional leaders. Leadership emerges through these interacting influences rather than through commands. ^MDI-def
- Conformers - One of two types of followers that support destructive leadership (Padilla et al., 2007). Conformers passively allow bad leaders to assume power because their unmet needs and immaturity make them vulnerable. ^Conformers-def
- Colluders - One of two types of followers that support destructive leadership (Padilla et al., 2007). Colluders actively support destructive leaders because they want to promote themselves in an enterprise consistent with their own worldview. ^Colluders-def

## Week 11:
- Constructive Dissent - A leadership practice involving the expression of disagreement in a way that moves debate forwards, engages with shared interests, offers alternatives, and commits to testing those alternatives. It requires followers who are independent from positional leaders but committed to acting responsibly in support of organisational or community goals. ^CD-def
- Constructive Conflict - An approach to conflict that enables people with different perspectives and opinions to express those views and work together to find a way forward, potentially including challenging powerful interests. Recognises that conflict can lead to innovation, stop poor practice, and promote the needs of marginalised groups. ^CC-def
- Leadership Without Authority - A concept from Heifetz (1994) describing leadership that comes from the bottom rather than the top. People who exercise leadership without authority have no formal position from which to influence others, instead drawing on different kinds of authority such as experience, expertise, or moral standing. ^LWA-def
- Heterarchy - An organisational form where leadership is distributed and moves between people depending on the situation, rather than being fixed in hierarchical positions. Associated with "Socratic" leaders who encourage debate and "responsible followers" who practise constructive dissent. Contrasts with hierarchy. ^Het-def
- Destructive Consent - A failure mode where followers become "yes people," following hierarchical leadership without question despite holding dissenting views. Associated with treating positional leaders as omniscient and failing to recognise or point out mistakes. Can lead to catastrophic outcomes. ^DC-def
- DELUDE Model - A conflict management framework for healthcare staff dealing with challenging patients: Don't take offence, Empathise, Listen, Understand, De-escalate, Engage constructively (Burnell, 2016). ^DELUDE-def
- Socratic Leadership - A leadership style that encourages debate and questioning in the tradition of Socrates, enabling constructive dissent. Socratic leaders operate within a heterarchy rather than hierarchy, acting as "wheelwrights" who facilitate distributed leadership rather than "emperors" who command from the top (Grint, 2005). ^SL-def

## Week 12:
- Positive-Sum Game - A leadership approach or outcome where all parties gain — a win/win scenario that increases resources for all players. Contrasts with zero-sum (win/lose) and negative-sum (everyone loses) approaches. ^PSG-def
- Negative-Sum Game - A leadership approach or outcome in fiercely competitive environments where total resources are decreasing. Even the winner only just survives while the loser is in serious trouble. A survival game where everyone loses, but some lose less than others. ^NSG-def
- Zero-Sum Game - A leadership approach or outcome where one individual, group, team, or organisation wins at the expense of others — a win/lose scenario where resources remain constant but transfer from one party to another. What one party gains, another loses. ^ZSG-def
- Leadership Narratives - The stories people tell about their experience of leadership, revealing how they make sense of leadership, justify their actions, and what difference they think leadership makes. Narratives can be analysed to identify positive, negative, or zero-sum assumptions. ^LN-def
- Collaborative Advantage - The achievement of something through collaboration that could not have been achieved by any of the partners acting alone. Represents the potential upside of collaborative working, contrasting with collaborative inertia (Huxham and Vangen, 2005). ^CA-def
- Integrative Leadership - Leadership for the common good that achieves widely beneficial outcomes through mindful leadership and active followership. Key practices include building strategic cross-boundary relationships, taking advantage of windows of opportunity, developing inclusive processes, and holding partners accountable for achieving the common good (Crosby and Bryson, 2005). ^IL-def
- Vision of Success - A detailed conception of what success looks like that develops over time, influencing and enabling practical decision making. It channels efforts while enabling improvisation, affirms the future in the present, enables distributed action without central direction, and takes on moral quality (Crosby and Bryson, 2005). ^VoS-def
- Common Good - Widely beneficial outcomes that are never preordained but arrived at through mindful leadership and active followership. It yields widespread benefit at reasonable cost and taps people's deepest interest in their own well-being and that of others. Goes beyond simple win/win outcomes (Crosby and Bryson, 2005). ^CG-def
- Competing Aims - The phenomenon where collaborating individuals, teams, and organisations have different aims at multiple levels (individual, team, organisation, collaboration) that may overlap at key points but also conflict. Creates a "tangled web" that challenges collaborative working. ^CompAims-def
