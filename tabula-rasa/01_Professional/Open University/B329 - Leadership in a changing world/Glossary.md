	- Typically they keep records, fill out forms, and keep the gears of communication running smoothly.
- Manager
	- Managers make plans and execute plans across various domains (Human, financial, material) to fulfil the goals of the leadership. ^Manager-def
	- So producing budgets and explaining what resources or skills are needed to achieved the targets of the organisation and managing deadlines.
- Identity
	- Identity refers to how individuals and groups define themselves internally (through beliefs, values, characteristics) and how they are defined by and relate to others externally (through social roles, cultural markers, group memberships). ^Identity-def
	- It encompasses both self-perception and social recognition, operating at individual and collective levels across multiple dimensions including race, ethnicity, religion, language, and culture.
- Identity Dimensions
	- Identity dimensions refers to four main dimensions: Remembered, Reflected, Programmed, Created. ^identity-dimensions-def
		- **Remembered Identity**: Our personal memories of past experiences (e.g., "I'm a bad tennis player because I remember losing matches")
		- **Reflected Identity**: How others tell us about our past ("I'm a bad listener because someone told me I was")
		- **Programmed Identity**: Beliefs others instill in us, often from childhood (Goldsmith's example: his mother programming him to believe he had no mechanical skills, which he accepted until age 28)
		- **Created Identity**: The identity we actively choose to create for ourselves
- Identity Construction
	- The shaping of yourself, usually through a strategic self presentation that aims to enhance positive ideas that you have about yourself. Otherwise, any effort to produce, maintain or recreate views about yourself. ^Identity-Construction-def
- Inspiring Leadership 
	- Energising and creating a sense of direction and purpose for employees and excitement and momentum for change where needed. It involves energising individuals to do their best in order to achieve a compelling vision of the future by embracing and following the organisation's values in all aspects of their work. ^Inspiring-Leadership-def
		- Personally, I more believe the following:
			- Creating conditions where people find meaning in their work, feel heard and trusted, and can contribute their best thinking. It involves providing clarity about direction while remaining open to challenge, removing obstacles, and building sustainable foundations that allow people to thrive without constant external motivation.
			- This means that you can cultivate a system that works and functions that doesn't require anything dramatic or speeches to happen.

- Global Inclusion - Is when you broaden what "inclusion" covers beyond traditional categories (race, gender) to include any dimension where valuable perspectives get systematically overlooked—function, generation, geography, seniority, technical vs. non-technical background. ^GI-def
	- It's understanding the idea that the barriers shift depending on the organisation and their personal blind spots.
- Situational leadership - Is a leadership style developed by Blanchard, Patricia,, and Zigarmi (1985). It refers to the need for a leader to adjust their leadership style to different situations and different levels of staff experiences and characteristics. ^SI-def
