# Week 4 Turbulent Contexts: Leadership in a Multicultural World:

Leadership and culture have a **directional** and **cyclical** structure in nature. The following diagram, illustrates the flow:

## Key Questions:
- What is culture and why does it have a substantial impact on leadership?
- What are the key differences in how leadership is thought about and practised in different cultures, and how does this affect leadership in a multicultural world?
- Can a multicultural approach to leadership be adopted that takes into account many different cultures and if so, how can such an approach be developed?

***

# 1. Developing a Deeper Understanding of Culture:


It's important to build the understanding of multiculturalism and our definition of culture, so that we can understand what we are looking at and how we can understand culture.

You can think of different levels of culture: *business culture, cultural change, youth culture, a culture of fear, etc.* So places and demographics can have a culture, so can art or museums have a culture.

If I was to define **culture:**

> Culture are the thoughts and ideas behind an action or creation.

## 1.1 Shaping the way We Think about the World:

At first when we talk about *culture* we focus on the surface level, we pretend we are an independent observer, yet we are shaped by the culture around us. Often we can understand other cultures, but experiencing it is a different story.

e.g. Someone from the UK might find it strange to bow to others in Japan, The Japanese in the UK might struggle with the interpersonal dynamics (More emotion, openness, etc.) in the UK

In essence, our thoughts aren't inherently our own, but have been shaped by the environment that we've grew up in, be it a household, city, or nation. Someone born and raised rural and a different values/ideas than urban - You could consider this scary, but really it's just a rational result to stimulus.

## 1.2 Defining Culture:

Academically, culture can be defined as effecting our thoughts, feelings, and emotions. From Schein and Schein:

> The *culture* of a group can be defined as the accumulated shared learning of that group as it solves its problems of external adaptation and internal integration; which has worked well enough to be considered valid and, therefore, to be taught to new members as the correct way to perceive, think, feel, and behave in relation to those problems. This accumulated learning is a pattern or system of beliefs, values, and behavioural norms that come to be taken for granted as basic assumptions and eventually drop out of awareness. ***(Schein and Schein, 2016 p. 6)***

In essence, culture progresses that the **conscious learning becomes unconscious** - A Japanese businessman starts to bow without thinking about it. 

So we can start to act, behave, or believe in ways that make no rational or logical sense, yet are ingrained in ourselves because the culture of a nation/environment, in order to fit in or navigate where we live.

Schein and Schein use the following diagram to illustrate this:
![[../../../03_Reference/Pictures/Culture-conscious-to-unconscious.png]]

The **correct** and **valid** solution to these internal and external problems, may be a successful well-rounded strategy, but it could also be actively harmful as well depending on the dynamics at play. It do believe that since working in cybersecurity, you have to understand this rule - and that it applies to culture as well:

> **There are often multiple solutions to the same problem.**

Each solution will have certain upsides and downsides, but don't **dismiss ideas or thoughts instantly because they don't agree with your culture or perspective**. *Though, this can be harder to do in practice.*

It helps to assess ideas pragmatically, objectively, even dispassionately. The focus shouldn't be on your own biases or preferences, but on the actual outcomes and what works in practice

## 1.3 Levels of Culture:

Using the lily pond analogy, we can discuss different levels of culture:

*Fig. Schein and Schein 2016, artwork from James Bowers.*

The process in which culture is formed, evolved, and is taken for granted can help answer our first key question: **Why culture has such large impact.** We are taught the correct way of doing things and thinking about problems, take them for granted, then they become part of the unconscious.

Describing the lily-pad model:

1. **Espoused values** - Openly communicated values and statements which are correct.
	1. The open university preaches for open to people, open to ideas, open to new methods and ideas.
2. **Cultural artifacts** - Visible and obvious signs of culture.
	1. Look at how a website or person appears, their history, and stated values they support
3. **Tacit cultural assumptions** - Looking at the underlying culture and how things *actually* are.
	1. Amazon may say they are about the safety of workers **(Espoused values)**, but on the factory floor, they injure and crush people physically and mentally. **(Cultural artefacts)**
		1. E.g. the culture within amazon is ruthlessly efficient and capitalistic. **(Tacit cultural assumptions)**
		2. The gap between what Amazon espouses and what actually happens reveals the true underlying assumptions that drive behaviour.

The submerged cultural ideas, are the root cause of the lily-pond either flourishing or dying.

### 1.3.1 Exploring Culture:

**Activity 2 - Exploring three levels of culture:**

**Q:** Thinking about the OU and specifically this module and its website:
- What are the lilies or cultural artefacts?
- What does the farmer and those who maintain the pond say about the pond and the lilies, or what are the espoused values?
- What is the hidden root system or basic assumptions?



**Q:** Think about and record the strengths and weaknesses of the metaphor of culture as a lily pond. Think in terms of how culture is like a lily pond – the strengths of the metaphor – and how it differs – the weaknesses of the metaphor.
