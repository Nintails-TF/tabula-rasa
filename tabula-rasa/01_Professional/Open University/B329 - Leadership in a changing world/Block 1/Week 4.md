# Week 4 Turbulent Contexts: Leadership in a Multicultural World:

Leadership and culture have a **directional** and **cyclical** structure in nature. The following diagram, illustrates the flow:

![[../../../../03_Reference/Pictures/diagram-for-culture.png]]

## Key Questions:
- What is culture and why does it have a substantial impact on leadership?
- What are the key differences in how leadership is thought about and practised in different cultures, and how does this affect leadership in a multicultural world?
- Can a multicultural approach to leadership be adopted that takes into account many different cultures and if so, how can such an approach be developed?

***

# 1. Developing a Deeper Understanding of Culture:


It's important to build the understanding of multiculturalism and our definition of culture, so that we can understand what we are looking at and how we can understand culture.

You can think of different levels of culture: *business culture, cultural change, youth culture, a culture of fear, etc.* So places and demographics can have a culture, so can art or museums have a culture.

If I was to define **culture:**

> Culture are the thoughts and ideas behind an action or creation.

![[../../../../03_Reference/Pictures/value-chart.png]]

## 1.1 Shaping the way We Think about the World:

At first when we talk about *culture* we focus on the surface level, we pretend we are an independent observer, yet we are shaped by the culture around us. Often we can understand other cultures, but experiencing it is a different story.

e.g. Someone from the UK might find it strange to bow to others in Japan, The Japanese in the UK might struggle with the interpersonal dynamics (More emotion, openness, etc.) in the UK

In essence, our thoughts aren't inherently our own, but have been shaped by the environment that we've grew up in, be it a household, city, or nation. Someone born and raised rural and a different values/ideas than urban - You could consider this scary, but really it's just a rational result to stimulus.

## 1.2 Defining Culture:

Academically, culture can be defined as effecting our thoughts, feelings, and emotions. From Schein and Schein:

> The *culture* of a group can be defined as the accumulated shared learning of that group as it solves its problems of external adaptation and internal integration; which has worked well enough to be considered valid and, therefore, to be taught to new members as the correct way to perceive, think, feel, and behave in relation to those problems. This accumulated learning is a pattern or system of beliefs, values, and behavioural norms that come to be taken for granted as basic assumptions and eventually drop out of awareness. ***(Schein and Schein, 2016 p. 6)***

In essence, culture progresses that the **conscious learning becomes unconscious** - A Japanese businessman starts to bow without thinking about it. 

So we can start to act, behave, or believe in ways that make no rational or logical sense, yet are ingrained in ourselves because the culture of a nation/environment, in order to fit in or navigate where we live.

Schein and Schein use the following diagram to illustrate this:
![[../../../../03_Reference/Pictures/Culture-conscious-to-unconscious.png]]

The **correct** and **valid** solution to these internal and external problems, may be a successful well-rounded strategy, but it could also be actively harmful as well depending on the dynamics at play. It do believe that since working in cybersecurity, you have to understand this rule - and that it applies to culture as well:

> **There are often multiple solutions to the same problem.**

Each solution will have certain upsides and downsides, but don't **dismiss ideas or thoughts instantly because they don't agree with your culture or perspective**. *Though, this can be harder to do in practice.*

It helps to assess ideas pragmatically, objectively, even dispassionately. The focus shouldn't be on your own biases or preferences, but on the actual outcomes and what works in practice

***
## 1.3 Levels of Culture:

Using the lily pond analogy, we can discuss different levels of culture:
![[../../../../03_Reference/Pictures/culutre-lily-pond.png]]
*Fig. Schein and Schein 2016, artwork from James Bowers.*

The process in which culture is formed, evolved, and is taken for granted can help answer our first key question: **Why culture has such large impact.** We are taught the correct way of doing things and thinking about problems, take them for granted, then they become part of the unconscious.

Describing the lily-pad model:

1. **Espoused values** - Openly communicated values and statements which are correct.
	1. The open university preaches for open to people, open to ideas, open to new methods and ideas.
2. **Cultural artifacts** - Visible and obvious signs of culture.
	1. Look at how a website or person appears, their history, and stated values they support
3. **Tacit cultural assumptions** - Looking at the underlying culture and how things *actually* are.
	1. Amazon may say they are about the safety of workers **(Espoused values)**, but on the factory floor, they injure and crush people physically and mentally. **(Cultural artefacts)**
		1. E.g. the culture within amazon is ruthlessly efficient and capitalistic. **(Tacit cultural assumptions)**
		2. The gap between what Amazon espouses and what actually happens reveals the true underlying assumptions that drive behaviour.

The submerged cultural ideas, are the root cause of the lily-pond either flourishing or dying.

### 1.3.1 Exploring Culture:

**Activity 2 - Exploring three levels of culture:**

**Q:** Thinking about the OU and specifically this module and its website:
- What are the lilies or cultural artefacts?
- What does the farmer and those who maintain the pond say about the pond and the lilies, or what are the espoused values?
- What is the hidden root system or basic assumptions?

**A:** The cultural artefacts (lilies) would be:
- Branding and marketing
- Course content
- Personnel
	- Students, peers
	- Lecturers, professors.
- Assessment structure, etc.

Espoused Values (farmers) would be:
- Open and affordable education
- Flexibility
- Support diversity 
- Critical thinking
- Reflection
- B329 specifics:
	- Leadership in complex environments
	- Encouraging reflection and critical analysis
	- Exploring multi-culturalism.

Tacit assumptions (roots) would be:
- If you deviate from their system you get screwed
	- Poor admin, not exactly customer support, but just structural issues with lecturers and the academic bloat and disingenuous. 
	- e.g. My account issues and lecturers doing nothing in October and slowly responding to things whilst saying: "We're on it and working!" - when I've experienced the opposite and received feedback from people working in the field and people that they are fucking about.
- It's more a algorithmic approach to leadership and managing education, which is fine, but they aren't 100% honest about it and try to paint themselves as being moral.
- Mostly is open and content is solid and about learning. Material is high quality and self-directed.
- Ethics and multiculturalism could be seen as a little pandering almost or forced. 
	- Example: How corporate or fervent "allies" of a cause could play a role here.
	- It's likely true that they value these things, but if it cost them money - I assume the sentiment would change.

As an educational institution they provide a powerful service - accreditation that is recognised wildly and high quality teaching (Strong content, TMAs, EMAs), but they suffer from systemic issues which hurt their own mission values, likely some people doing great work whilst others coasting.

**Q:** Think about and record the strengths and weaknesses of the metaphor of culture as a lily pond. Think in terms of how culture is like a lily pond – the strengths of the metaphor – and how it differs – the weaknesses of the metaphor.

| **Strengths of the Lily Pond Metaphor**                                                                                   | **Weaknesses of the Lily Pond Metaphor**                                                                                                     |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Visual clarity** - Easy to understand the three distinct layers of culture at a glance                                  | **Too static** - Suggests culture is stable and unchanging, but real organizational culture is dynamic and constantly evolving               |
| **Shows interconnection** - Demonstrates how the roots (assumptions) support and nourish the visible parts (artifacts)    | **Oversimplified** - Culture is messier with contradictions, conflicts, and ambiguities that don't fit neatly into three layers              |
| **Emphasizes the hidden** - Highlights that the most powerful aspects of culture lie beneath the surface, often invisible | **Linear hierarchy** - Implies a one-way relationship (roots → water → lilies), but culture elements influence each other bidirectionally    |
| **Natural growth** - Suggests culture develops organically over time through shared learning and experience               | **Single entity assumption** - Organizations have multiple subcultures (departments, teams, locations), not one unified pond                 |
| **Holistic perspective** - Shows culture as a complete, interconnected ecosystem rather than isolated elements            | **No human agency** - Lilies don't choose to change or resist; people actively shape, challenge, and transform culture                       |
| **Memorable** - The metaphor is easy to recall and apply in analysis                                                      | **Missing power dynamics** - Doesn't show whose values dominate, how culture is contested, or how leadership shapes culture                  |
| **Shows depth** - Illustrates that understanding culture requires looking beyond surface-level observations               | **Ignores external forces** - Real organizations exist in broader societal contexts (economic, political, technological) that affect culture |
| **Accessible language** - Makes a complex academic concept understandable to diverse audiences                            | **Deterministic feel** - Suggests culture naturally follows from assumptions, missing intentional culture change efforts                     |

# 1.4 Exploring the Multiculture:

Multiculturalism has different meanings, but generally it's distinct from International (One culture dominates - e.g. Foreigners in homogenous countries (e.g. Being white in Africa, or black in Asia, or Asian in Nordic countries, you face pressure.)

Multiculturalism is more about different cultures of people working together, so the US and Western Europe tend to be more multicultural and progressive (All be it, with a growing right-wing populist concerns).

![[../../../../03_Reference/Pictures/Pasted image 20251103120049.png]]

# 2. Leadership and Culture:

We can define **leadership** within this module as:

>*A collection of concepts concerned with how meaningful direction is generated, offered, accepted and resisted within and across groups and organisations.* **(Smolović Jones, 2018)**

A big conflict you are going to have is that **leadership** and **culture** - especially if they have conflicting cultural backgrounds - can end up fighting each other rather than working together, which undermines the pursuit of goals.

**Cultural resistance** in this setting would mean that newcomers reject the leadership's status quo. For example, Gen Z workers versus traditional management expectations regarding unpaid overtime and work-life balance, where younger employees advocate for better scheduling and boundaries.

Schein and Schein (2016) states that leadership and culture are intertwined:
- That leaders as entrepreneurs who found organisations are the main architects of culture – using the lily pond metaphor they build the pond and plant the lilies
- That after cultures are formed, the culture influences the kind of leadership that is possible – to stretch the metaphor, you cannot plant lilies and expect to farm corn.
	- e.g., Companies like Activision Blizzard cultivated male-dominated "frat boy" cultures that initially drove productivity but eventually became toxic and harmful, leading to documented cases of [sexual harassment, discrimination, and unequal pay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Department_of_Fair_Employment_and_Housing_v._Activision_Blizzard). The culture that once worked became increasingly dysfunctional as the organization scaled.
	- Culture was likely less extreme during the founding years of Blizzard but accelerated and became worse as passionate people with strong characters left, working conditions became harsher (more stress, overtime, pressure), and world became more precarious than 1990s-2008 era.
- if the culture becomes dysfunctional, leadership can and must do something to speed up cultural change – much as a farmer with a failing crop needs to act promptly to restore an environment in which the plants can thrive.

## 2.1 Moving from Cultural Leadership to Multicultural Leadership:

The most common approach for leaders to develop a multicultural approach is to develop and awareness of their own culture as its impact on them and then to study a foreign culture of their colleagues to enhance understand of different cultures.

The organisation **GLOBE** *(Global Leadership and Organisational Behaviour Effective research project)* has divided the world culture into nine dimensions of national culture and ten regional clusters.

### 2.2 Nine GLOBE Dimensions of National Cultures:

Each of these characteristics are rated on a spectrum from low to high.

- **Assertiveness** - How direct, confrontational, and aggressive people are in social interactions. Germany: direct and confrontational.
- **Future Orientation** - Whether societies plan ahead or focus on past/present. USA: future-focused with planning. Middle East: past-oriented, values tradition.
- **Gender Egalitarianism** - Degree of gender equality and minimized role differences. Sweden: high equality. Afghanistan: distinct gender roles.
- **Humane Orientation** - How much societies reward kindness, generosity, and altruism. Southern Asia and sub-Saharan Africa score high.
	- Large amounts of hospitality.
- **Institutional Collectivism** - Extent of collective resource distribution and action. North Korea and Nordic countries score high.
- **In-Group Collectivism** - Pride and loyalty to small groups (family, teams). China, Japan, Singapore: high. USA, Canada, UK, Australia: low.
- **Performance Orientation** - Emphasis on excellence and performance improvement. USA: very high. Latin America and Eastern Europe: lower.
- **Power Distance** - Acceptance of unequal power distribution. India: high hierarchy. USA: low. UK: moderate-high (class system influence).
- **Uncertainty Avoidance** - Preference for rules and predictability over risk. USA: low (risk-taking). Kuwait and Egypt: high (risk-averse).

### 2.2.1 Ten GLOBE Regional Clusters:

- **Anglo Cultures** - High in performance orientation and low in group collectivism.
- **Confucian Asia** - High in performance orientation, institutional collectivism and in group collectivism
- **Eastern Europe** - High in assertiveness, group collectivism and gender egalitarianism.
- **Germanic Europe** - High in performance orientation, assertiveness, future orientation, uncertainty avoidance, low in humane orientation, institutional collectivism and group collectivism.
- **Latin America** - High in group collectivism and low in performance orientation, future orientation, institutional collectivism and uncertainty avoidance.
- **Latin Europe** - High in power distance, low on humane orientation and aspects of collectivism.
- **Middle East** - High in group collectivism, low on future orientation, gender egalitarianism, and uncertainty avoidance.
- **Nordic Europe** - High in future orientation, gender egalitarianism, institutional collectivism, and uncertainty avoidance. Low in assertiveness, group collectivism and power distance.
- **Southern Asia** - High in humane orientation and group collectivism.
- **Sub-Saharan Africa** - High on humane orientation.

You could map your own personal values and ideals to these globe regional clusters and get a decent idea of an environment that would suit you.

## 2.3 Understanding Leadership in Different Cultures:


**Q:** Freja is a Danish born team leader in a large Danish company. Review the nine cultural dimensions and identify which ones are particularly high, medium or low in the Danish culture. What do you think that this means for the way that Freja lead her team?

**A:**

| **Cultural Dimension**         | **Denmark (Level)** | **Implications for Freja’s Leadership**                                                                                                                |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Assertiveness**              | Low                 | Freja likely leads through consensus, diplomacy, and calm discussion rather than confrontation. Likely minimises aggression.                           |
| **Future Orientation**         | High                | Freja emphasizes planning, sustainability, and long-term strategies. Could perhaps underweight short-term gains that might be necessary in the moment. |
| **Gender Egalitarianism**      | Very High           | Freja treats men and women equally, expects gender balance in decision-making and equal treatment.                                                     |
| **Humane Orientation**         | High                | Freja shows genuine care for her team, values empathy and well-being, and work-life balance.                                                           |
| **Institutional Collectivism** | High                | She encourages teamwork, shared responsibility, and group-oriented success over individual competition.                                                |
| **In-Group Collectivism**      | Medium-Low          | Freja values collaboration but maintains professional boundaries; loyalty is to the organization and team goals rather than personal ties.             |
| **Performance Orientation**    | Medium              | While she values competence and quality, these aren't sacrificed for ethical requirements.                                                             |
| **Power Distance**             | Very Low            | Freja leads as a facilitator, not a boss. She expects open communication, invites feedback, and treats subordinates as equals.                         |
| **Uncertainty Avoidance**      | Medium-Low          | She is comfortable with flexibility and innovation, allowing autonomy and creative problem-solving rather than rigid rules.                            |
**Summary:** Freja's leadership is *egalitarian, empathic, trust building, and considers a wider range of perspective*. She'll downplay hierarchy + internal competition, encourage open discussion and ensure that people are heard. Which is the **Nordic leadership** playbook.

**Q:** Imagine Freja gets a new job as a more senior leader in the US multinational organisation. There are not any other leaders from Denmark in the company but there are other leaders from Sweden and Finland although most of the senior leaders are American. Denote which clusters are present in leadership. What advice might you give Freja as she prepares to take on her new position?

**A:** The two clusters that are present are **Anglo Culture** (US) and **Nordic Culture** (Finland and Sweden). There are key differences between the two that would effect her in her new job.

1. Assertiveness and Individualism
	1. US leaders and people are more confident even if they don't have all the facts, meaning communication could be more confrontational and people would act more self-centred than the Nordic culture.
	2. **Problem:** Freja could appear as being overly diplomatic and indecisive or unconfident.
	3. **Solution:** Work with and monitor the Swedes and the Finns, see how they have adapted their approach to suit the US environment, build rapport with US leaders/employees gain experience with this conformational style, so that emotionally they are used to it.
2. Performance Orientation and Future Orientation
	1. US companies tend to focus on short-term gains and having more targets, results, and competition. Danes also do this, but not to the same extent.
	2. **Problem:** Freja could feel pressure for aggressive goal setting or clash with quarterly outcomes that sacrifice in the long run.
	3. **Solution:** Emphasize results in a collaborative way - frame performance goals in terms of benefiting everyone and long-term sustainability.

This isn't an exhaustive list, but provides concrete examples of the challenges that not only leaders, but anyone moving to a new culture may face. Don't abandon your own culture, but present parts of your own whilst adapting to a new culture.

## 2.4 Challenges to the GLOBE Research

The GLOBE model isn't perfect, it's more of a heuristic that gives a surface level understanding of different cultures and what they typically value. It gives a good starting point, but isn't the only tool that should be used within leadership.

#### Strengths:
- The GLOBE model is data-driven and broad, it takes details from 17,000 managers across 62 countries. It's one of the most empirical works on leadership and cultural values.
- The model provides a clear view of cultures and values, which is useful in creating your baseline of what to expect.
- It enables leaders to map themselves to a block and compare it with others. Which is practically useful.

#### Weaknesses:
- The model is generic - and doesn't consider the individual. Different people with different life experiences, don't always map neatly to a culture list.
- The model is limited as it's constructed by middle managers, who might not always reflect other parties such as employees or minorities.
- The model is static and aging - these culture values asserted, will not always be accurate - culture changes all the time.

***

# 3. Leading Multicultural Organisations:

Certain organisations may have to challenge traditional or the overarching culture in the Area, for example: Butterflies in India - helps street children, where Rita Panicker Pinto leads a non-hierarchical structure uncommon in Indian culture as High power-distance often applies.

Butterflies is part of the **Family for every child** - A global alliance of local civil organisations working to improve the lives of children.

**Family for Every Child** did not want to create an international culture, but wanted to have a multi-cultural approach - understanding what different cultured needed and meeting them there, rather than enforcing an Anglo view on an Indian/African/Asian Org.

The CEO of Family for every child Amanda Griffith states:

1. Local first approach with indigenous participation.
	1. Empower locals and their structure, rather than imposing a blanket homogenous structure.
2. Promoting multicultural values and inclusive staffing.
	1. Listen to values from across the globe. No one culture dominates.
3. Using a fully remote environment
	1. Connects the global workforce together with each other for collaboration.
4. Working with the challenges of multi-lingual communication.
	1. Using translations and ensuring that people are heard, rather than focusing on speed.
	2. There is no "language of business" such as English for communication.
5. Fosters democratic and participatory leadership.
	1. Decisions aren't made by a single leader or small board member group, but by large groups of people through voting.

***

# 4. Developing a Global Mindset:

The most key feature of developing a global mindset as researched by Cseh et all (2013) is the **willingness to learn about other cultures and leadership practices.**

The GLM model developed by Davis et all (2008) has three elements that guide learning about other cultures and leadership practices:

- **Orientation**
	- Be aware and cognizant about your own beliefs and values. Be flexible in your ideas and approaches especially when working with multicultural issues.
- **Knowledge**
	- Learn about different structures and concepts about leadership, so that you become aware of other other cultures and organisations operate.
- **Behaviour**
	- Experiment and act in ways with the knowledge that you've learned.


***

## Reflections:

Culture formulates due to different approaches to problems that we face, these methods become entrenched overtime as the **right** way of doing things as to offload the solution to sub-conscious. However, cultures and problems can change, meaning that a static way of leading - especially with growing turbulence, precarity and global markets/connections - is limited and brittle.

The most useful insight was the idea of **tacit cultural implications**, in other words, looking at why things happen due to underlying culture.

For example:
- Amazon may _say_ they are about the safety of workers **(Espoused values)**, but on the factory floor, they injure and crush people physically and mentally through rate quotas and ToT. **(Cultural artefacts)**
- In essence, the culture within amazon is _ruthlessly efficient_ and _capitalistic._ **(Tacit cultural assumptions)**

The gap between what Amazon espouses and what actually happens reveals the true underlying assumptions that drive behaviour.  
  
This has made me evaluate what is **actually** happening, not just what is being said. Enhancing my ability as a leader to make meaningful change.
