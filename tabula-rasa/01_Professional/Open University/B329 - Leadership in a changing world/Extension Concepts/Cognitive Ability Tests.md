## Considerations for Use

### Validity

Cognitive ability tests have strong predictive validity for job performance but should be used alongside other measures for comprehensive assessment.

### Adverse Impact

Some cognitive tests show mean score differences across demographic groups, which can create legal and ethical concerns. Organizations must ensure job-relatedness and consider alternative assessments.

### Candidate Experience

Lengthy or frustrating assessments can deter qualified candidates. Game-based and adaptive formats attempt to improve engagement.

### Cheating & Security

Remote administration increases concerns about test security. Proctoring solutions and time-limited formats help mitigate risks.
