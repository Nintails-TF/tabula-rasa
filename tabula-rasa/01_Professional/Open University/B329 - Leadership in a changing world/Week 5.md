# Week 5 - Leading through Turbulent Contexts:

# Introduction:

The purpose of week 5 is to draw connections between the topics that we've covered so far:

- **Precarity** - Uncertainty, lack of stability due to many internal and external factors. How leaders can minimize precarity or make the best of it.
- **Populism** - Framing problems as noble average versus corrupt elite. Charismatic leaders who will change and fix the system.
- **Multiculturalism** - How different groups of people have learned to solve problems based on their environment. How leaders can navigate and unite these cultures.

What do these have to do with each other?
1. All of these are pertinent phenomena in our changing world - they aren't going away anytime soon. They all contribute to turbulence, in there own way.
2. They are issues frequently discussed in public media and social media.

### Key Questions

The key questions you will consider this week are:

- How are precarity, populism and multiculturalism represented in public discourse?
- How could I better understand the different perspectives of leadership?
- How are blog posts relevant to contemporary leadership?

***

# 1. Exploring Perspectives of Leadership:

Your choice of leader has to be someone from the public domain (e.g. business leader/manager, politician, sportsperson, social activist, etc.). The main plan is:

1. Identify public info about a chosen leadership figure to build a interview questions.
2. Write a plan and interview questions
3. Write a reflection.

## 1.1. Planning an Interview:

Interviews are a great method of gathering qualitative data and evidence about a domain. Responses aren't numerical in questionnaires or surveys. There are different approaches you can follow:

**Different Types of Interviews:**
- Unstructured interview
	- Interviewer uses a memory aid or notes to jog the memory, flows like a conversation and enables both parties to speak freely.
- Semi-structured interview
	- Interviewer has a list of key points or questions and works through them, similar questions are asked to each interviewee, no "tick box" for each answer and supplemental questions can be asked.
- Structured interview
	- Interviewer asks the interviewee a series of specific questions where they are right and wrong answers. Similar to a questionnaire, used in social survey research frequently.

**Planning an interview:**
- Try to have a sequence to your questions or topics by grouping them in themes that follow a logical sequence.
- That said, make sure you can easily move back and forth between questions or topic areas.
- Make sure your questions are clear and easy to understand – only use technical or academic language if you are sure your interviewee will understand what you mean.
- Plan your questions to ensure people are free to give their own honest answers.

**Questions types:**
- **Introducing questions:** ‘Why did you...?’ or ‘Can you tell me about...?’ Through these questions you introduce the topic.
- **Follow-up questions:** Through these you can elaborate on the interviewee’s initial answer. Questions may include: ‘What did you mean...?’ or ‘Can you give more detail...?’
- **Probing questions:** You can employ direct questioning to follow up what has been said and to get more detail. ‘Do you have any examples?’ or ‘Could you say more about...?’
- **Specifying questions:** Such as ‘What happened when you said that?‘ or ‘What did he say next?’
- **Direct questions:** Questions with a ‘yes’ or ‘no’ answer are direct, closed questions. You might want to leave these questions until the end so you don’t lead the interviewee to answer a certain way.
- **Indirect questions:** You can ask these to get the interviewee’s true opinion. For example if you want to know which political party somebody supports, you may want to ask what are some of the policies or political ideas she/he agrees with.
- **Structuring questions:** These move the interview on to the next subject. For example, ‘Moving on to...’
- **Silence:** Through pauses you can suggest to the interviewee that you want them to answer the question!
- **Interpreting questions:** ‘Do you mean that...?’ or ‘Is it correct that...?’

## 1.2. Organising Your Interview:

Idea: Discuss precarity and populism under the context of young people.

**What I want to know?:**
- Problems that young people face
	- Housing prices - Can't afford houses due to high prices.
		- Impact - Delayed independence, postponed family, financial stress.
	- Gig economy - Unpredictable income, lack of benefits, limited career/skills progression.
		- Impact - Difficulty saving and planning for the future, and developing skills.
	- Transactional Leadership - Feeling disposable, undervalued, and stuck in performance metrics. Systems and computers track performance in ways that make them feel disposable and undervalued.
		- Impact - Low morale, burnout, limited autonomy, feeling trapped.
	- Student Debt
		- Fear about the future, feeling like a “Sword of Damocles” hangs over them, affecting life choices and long-term planning.
- These problems push young people towards populism because they want a quick fix, or don't trust establishments to change.
	- Populist rhetoric encourages them to stir up and shake the system, strong to those who feel left behind.
	- Young people have nothing to lose anyways -> become increasingly radicalised in either direction.
	- Charismatic populist leaders may/may not actually help, the sentiment could be performative or genuine, but most likely a mix of both.
	- Radical could change or break systems.

**Who could I ask about this?:**

**SOSE YAF member - Hannah Brise** - I'm 24 and I'm from Newton Stewart, I've been on the Youth Advisory form for 2 years now. I enjoy seeing whatever input I have a difference, that's what makes me keep coming back. It was my main motivation when I joined was to have my voice on a table that it wouldn't normally be on. If it wasn't for the Forum, I don't think I would have been able to apply for uni to go into community development and education this year, it's always been something on the back of my mind but my involvement in the Forum and the personal journey I've been on and hopefully starting and getting a degree at some point in my life.

**What would they say?:**
- Talk about personal struggles
- Talk about what they do at the forum
- etc

## 1.3 Writing Your Questions:

### Section 1: Establishing Precarity (3 questions)

_Start by grounding the conversation in concrete experiences of precarity_

1. **"You've mentioned struggling to find the confidence to apply for university. What kinds of pressures or uncertainties do you and other young people in Newton Stewart or the Wider UK face?"**
    - _Gets at: personal experience of precarity, economic and social barriers_
2. **"Researchers talk about young people facing a 'perfect storm' - unaffordable housing, zero-hour contracts, student debt, economic pressure. How do you see these issues playing out among people our age?"**
    - _Gets at: defining precarity, intersecting pressures_
3. **"When you're working unstable jobs, can't afford a home, and don't know what next month looks like - how does that affect your ability to believe in a stable future?"**
    - _Gets at: psychological impact of precarity, erosion of hope_

---

### Section 2: Trust in Traditional Institutions (3-4 questions)

_Establish why young people feel abandoned by the establishment_
4. **"Traditional politicians often promise to help young people, but housing keeps getting more expensive, wages stay low, and conditions don't improve. Do you think young people still trust that mainstream political parties are working for them?"**
    - _Gets at: erosion of trust in "the elite," setting up populist appeal_
5. **"When young people turn to governments, employers, or established institutions for help with precarity, what kind of response do they typically get?"**
    - _Gets at: specific failures of traditional structures, feeling unheard_
6. **"Some people describe the current system as 'the elite' protecting their own interests while ordinary people struggle. Does that framing resonate with your experience and the people you work with?"**
    - _Gets at: introducing populist "people vs elite" framework naturally_

---

### Section 3: The Appeal of Populism (4-5 questions)

_Explore why precarity makes populist movements attractive_

7. **"When people feel powerless and ignored by traditional politics, they often become attracted to leaders who promise radical change - to 'shake up the system' or 'drain the swamp.' Why do you think that message appeals to young people facing precarity?"**
    - _Gets at: populist appeal, desire for disruption_
8. **"Populist movements often frame politics as 'the virtuous people versus the corrupt elite.' When you're struggling to make ends meet while seeing wealthy people and corporations get richer, does that narrative feel true?"**
    - _Gets at: populism definition, validation of frustration_
9. **"Some populist leaders are charismatic figures who promise quick fixes to complex problems. What makes that more appealing than traditional politicians who talk about gradual reform or compromise?"**
    - _Gets at: charismatic leadership, impatience with incrementalism_
10. **"Young people are increasingly voting for parties on the far left and far right - movements that promise to completely overturn the system. Do you think that's because young people genuinely want extreme solutions, or because they feel they have nothing left to lose?"**
	- _Gets at: radicalization driven by desperation, "nothing to lose" concept_
11. **"Some researchers say that when people face precarity - uncertainty, instability, feeling disposable - they become more vulnerable to populist rhetoric. Do you think economic insecurity makes people more willing to take risks on radical political solutions?"**
	- _Gets at: direct link between precarity and populist susceptibility_

---

### Section 4: The Dangers and Alternatives (3-4 questions)

_Critically examine populism while exploring healthier responses_

12. **"Not all populist movements are the same. Some fight for workers' rights and social justice, while others scapegoat immigrants or minorities. How can young people tell the difference between populism that empowers people and populism that divides them?"**
	- _Gets at: left vs right populism, ethical dimensions_

13. **"Populist movements often rely on a single charismatic leader who promises to fight for 'the people.' But history shows this can be dangerous - leaders can become unaccountable, break promises, or use their power unethically. What are the risks of putting all your faith in one person to save you?"**
	- _Gets at: risks of charismatic leadership, accountability issues_
14. **"The Youth Advisory Forum seems like a different kind of response to young people feeling powerless - more grassroots, collective, focused on building power from the ground up. How is that different from following a populist leader who promises to fix everything for you?"**
	- _Gets at: grassroots organizing vs top-down populism_
15. **"When you said the Forum gave you 'a voice on a table it wouldn't normally be on' - that sounds like challenging the elite/establishment, which is also what populists claim to do. What's the difference between healthy democratic participation and destructive populism?"**
	- _Gets at: distinguishing legitimate resistance from dangerous populism_

---

### **Section 5: Moving Forward (2 questions)**

_End with how to channel frustration productively_

16. **"For young people who feel angry, abandoned, and ready to support anyone who promises to blow up the system - what would you say to them about channelling that energy in ways that actually create positive change rather than just destruction?"**

- _Gets at: productive vs destructive responses to precarity_

17. **"Do you think the answer to precarity is waiting for the right populist leader to save us, or is it young people organizing themselves to demand systemic change from the bottom up?"**

- _Gets at: agency vs dependency, call to action_

# 2. Planning and Writing a Blog Post:

To write a successful blog post, I need the following:

- a catchy title aimed at getting attention
- a key message illustrated by a well-developed argument which
    - states a position (making clear what you think about a particular issue)
    - gives reasons for that position (making clear why you think what you think about that particular issue)
    - supported by evidence (making clear how you support your position and the reasons for it with facts, well-known and respected arguments by other people, or your own experience and/or that of other people)
- a representative image within the main body of the blog post
- a conversational tone, no jargon and no dense language
- key references to external sources where possible.

Quality blog posts also follow the invested pyramid or other structures:
![[../../../03_Reference/Pictures/inverted-pyramid.png]]

## 2.1 Newsworthiness:

Newsworthiness is about grabbing the attention and presenting information in a way that invests the public or your audience.

Precarity, populism, and multiculturalism are there important issues in modern society. So the challenge is, how do you link what you do or think or say to these issues in order to drum up a buzz.

This is key in leadership, you need to be able to mobilise people for action and making an impact.

### Tricks for Making Work More Newsworthy:

1. Link your work to another popular event or topic.
	1. Piggyback off current events to make the work feel more recent.
2. Identify and highlight unique or landmark aspects
	1. Highlight what makes your work stand out.
3. Use emotion to engage the audience
	1. Use outrage, humour, hope, fear, etc.
	2. Make people feel something about your work.
4. Simplify and make it accessible
	1. Show don't tell, avoid academic terms where possible.
	2. Use examples and human stories to make the information relatable and easy to grasp.
5. Use lateral thinking
	1. Use different or common sense items to explain more serious or obscure concepts.
		1. We've all heard it before the rich vs the poor, the educated vs the uneducated.

## 2.2 Speaking to Different Audiences:

Flinders (2012) talked about the importance of academics of "triple writing", which is a technique used to display work to different levels of audiences.

- **Phase 1:** Research results, findings and implications are written up into traditional academic outputs like books and articles (i.e. single-writing).
	- Papers, books and academic journals.
- **Phase 2:** The same research then forms the basis of a short research note that is intended to be both accessible and of value to a range of user groups (i.e. double-writing).
	- Online and physical news, blogs and reports, etc.
- **Phase 3:** In the final stage the research forms the focus of a number of succinct, pithy and even controversial articles for newspapers, magazines or popular websites (i.e. triple-writing).
	- Social media pieces, Podcasts, etc.

For the TMA 01, it's going to be a phase 2 piece, that relates to young people and tries to inspire them to action if they feel screwed by the societal structure and problems in place.

## 2.3. Images of Leadership:

# 2.4. Beginning Your Blog Post:

My top 3 titles are:

Top 3:
1. The Generation with Nothing to Lose
2. No House, No Hope, No Problem?
3. The Algorithm Knows You're Replaceable
   
My introductory sentence is:

Zero-hour contracts. Algorithmic bosses. Unaffordable housing. Welcome to the expendable generation - where stability is a luxury and young people work harder for less, with no voice in the systems that exploit them.

# Summary for TGF (Tutor Group Form):

What have I learned this week that is particularly important or relevant?
How could this inspire me to make a change in my professional or personal life?

This week I realised the importance of **attention** - that it doesn’t matter what content you create or what you ask for; you must first capture people’s **attention** and use your words precisely.

> **Attention** is the gateway to influence.

This insight has inspired me to analyse how I can design better marketing for my business and consider how to appeal more effectively to clients by leveraging tools such as _emotional resonance, strong value propositions, and connections to issues people care about.
