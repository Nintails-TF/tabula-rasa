# Week 5 - Leading through Turbulent Contexts:

# Introduction:

The purpose of week 5 is to draw connections between the topics that we've covered so far:

- **Precarity** - Uncertainty, lack of stability due to many internal and external factors. How leaders can minimize precarity or make the best of it.
- **Populism** - Framing problems as noble average versus corrupt elite. Charismatic leaders who will change and fix the system.
- **Multiculturalism** - How different groups of people have learned to solve problems based on their environment. How leaders can navigate and unite these cultures.

What do these have to do with each other?
1. All of these are pertinent phenomena in our changing world - they aren't going away anytime soon. They all contribute to turbulence, in there own way.
2. They are issues frequently discussed in public media and social media.

### Key Questions

The key questions you will consider this week are:

- How are precarity, populism and multiculturalism represented in public discourse?
- How could I better understand the different perspectives of leadership?
- How are blog posts relevant to contemporary leadership?

# 1. Exploring Perspectives of Leadership:

Your choice of leader has to be someone from the public domain (e.g. business leader/manager, politician, sportsperson, social activist, etc.). The main plan is:

1. Identify public info about a chosen leadership figure to build a interview questions.
2. Write a plan and interview questions
3. Write a reflection.

## 1.1. Planning an Interview:

Interviews are a great method of gathering qualitative data and evidence about a domain. Responses aren't numerical in questionnaires or surveys. There are different approaches you can follow:

**Different Types of Interviews:**
- Unstructured interview
	- Interviewer uses a memory aid or notes to jog the memory, flows like a conversation and enables both parties to speak freely.
- Semi-structured interview
	- Interviewer has a list of key points or questions and works through them, similar questions are asked to each interviewee, no "tick box" for each answer and supplemental questions can be asked.
- Structured interview
	- Interviewer asks the interviewee a series of specific questions where they are right and wrong answers. Similar to a questionnaire, used in social survey research frequently.

**Planning an interview:**
- Try to have a sequence to your questions or topics by grouping them in themes that follow a logical sequence.
- That said, make sure you can easily move back and forth between questions or topic areas.
- Make sure your questions are clear and easy to understand – only use technical or academic language if you are sure your interviewee will understand what you mean.
- Plan your questions to ensure people are free to give their own honest answers.

**Questions types:**
- **Introducing questions:** ‘Why did you...?’ or ‘Can you tell me about...?’ Through these questions you introduce the topic.
- **Follow-up questions:** Through these you can elaborate on the interviewee’s initial answer. Questions may include: ‘What did you mean...?’ or ‘Can you give more detail...?’
- **Probing questions:** You can employ direct questioning to follow up what has been said and to get more detail. ‘Do you have any examples?’ or ‘Could you say more about...?’
- **Specifying questions:** Such as ‘What happened when you said that?‘ or ‘What did he say next?’
- **Direct questions:** Questions with a ‘yes’ or ‘no’ answer are direct, closed questions. You might want to leave these questions until the end so you don’t lead the interviewee to answer a certain way.
- **Indirect questions:** You can ask these to get the interviewee’s true opinion. For example if you want to know which political party somebody supports, you may want to ask what are some of the policies or political ideas she/he agrees with.
- **Structuring questions:** These move the interview on to the next subject. For example, ‘Moving on to...’
- **Silence:** Through pauses you can suggest to the interviewee that you want them to answer the question!
- **Interpreting questions:** ‘Do you mean that...?’ or ‘Is it correct that...?’

## 1.2. Organising Your Interview:

Idea: Discuss precarity and populism under the context of young people.

**What I want to know?:**
- Problems that young people face
	- Housing prices - Can't afford houses due to high prices.
		- Impact - Delayed independence, postponed family, financial stress.
	- Gig economy - Unpredictable income, lack of benefits, limited career/skills progression.
		- Impact - Difficulty saving and planning for the future, and developing skills.
	- Transactional Leadership - Feeling disposable, undervalued, and stuck in performance metrics. Systems and computers track performance in ways that make them feel disposable and undervalued.
		- Impact - Low morale, burnout, limited autonomy, feeling trapped.
	- Student Debt
		- Fear about the future, feeling like a “Sword of Damocles” hangs over them, affecting life choices and long-term planning.
- These problems push young people towards populism because they want a quick fix, or don't trust establishments to change.
	- Populist rhetoric encourages them to stir up and shake the system, strong to those who feel left behind.
	- Young people have nothing to lose anyways -> become increasingly radicalised in either direction.
	- Charismatic populist leaders may/may not actually help, the sentiment could be performative or genuine, but most likely a mix of both.
	- Radical could change or break systems.

**Who could I ask about this?:**

**SOSE YAF member - Hannah Brise** - I'm 24 and I'm from Newton Stewart, I've been on the Youth Advisory form for 2 years now. I enjoy seeing whatever input I have a difference, that's what makes me keep coming back. It was my main motivation when I joined was to have my voice on a table that it wouldn't normally be on. If it wasn't for the Forum, I don't think I would have been able to apply for uni to go into community development and education this year, it's always been something on the back of my mind but my involvement in the Forum and the personal journey I've been on and hopefully starting and getting a degree at some point in my life.

**What would they say?:**
- Talk about personal struggles
- Talk about what they do at the forum
- etc
