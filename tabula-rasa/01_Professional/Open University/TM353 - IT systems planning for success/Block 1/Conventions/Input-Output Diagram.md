# Purpose:
Show how a system transforms inputs into outputs - what happens to resources when the system operates on them?
# Elements:
- Arrows showing causality.
- Rectangle to store the transformation process.
	- Should be expressible as a verb.
- Inputs/Outputs - List specific resources that go in on the left, and list what emerges on the right as Outputs.
# Conventions:
- Be comprehensive, but don't include trivial pieces of information.
- Use a parallel structure to clearly highlight cause -> effect
- Show realistic outcomes, both positive and negative.
# Guidelines:
- Keep it simple.
- Use clear labels

# Example:
