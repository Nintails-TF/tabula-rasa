# Purpose:
To depict what is going on within a complex system visually and clearly.

# Elements:
- Pictures and symbols
- Key words
- Cartoons
- Sketches and symbols
- Title

# Conventions:
- Avoid doing too much writing
	- Use word bubbles or speech bubbles.
- Represent each perspective or observation that you've seen during your investigation.
- Fall back onto words if you cannot sketch something or display it visually.
	- Crossing of swords for conflict, £ for money, <3 for love, hats with roles, stick people, etc.
- Place pictures wherever you want, a trend can reveal itself later.

# Guidelines:
- You present the picture from your perspective and the details that you have.
- The following structure can help
	1. Look for the elements of structure, what doesn't change rapidly (People, setups, command hierarchy, etc.)
	2. Look for the processes of structure, what does change (Activities going on, events, timings.)
	3. Look at how the elements interact with the processes, figure out the relationship between them.
	4. Don't think in system terms quite yet. There are two reasons for this;
		1. System implies that there is interconnectedness, there may not be that connection and the lack of connection may be why a problem exists.
		2. Systems thinking will cause use to think about how to make a system more efficient and to search for that path, when that may not be the goal.
	5. Include hard factual data and soft subjective data.
	6. Look at the social roles that are meaningful and expressed by those in the situation.
	7. Consider if you should be part of the picture, that you aren't objective but have values, beliefs, and norms that colour your perceptions.
