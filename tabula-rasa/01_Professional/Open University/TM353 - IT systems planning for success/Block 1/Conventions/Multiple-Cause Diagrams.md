# Purpose:

The purpose of a multiple-cause diagram is to consider how events combine together to form a larger problem. They can identify feedback loops and get closer to the root issue of why things are happening.

Think of it as starting to untie a bundle of string.

# Elements:
- A title describing the purpose of the diagram.
- Phrases used to describe the event/states
- Arrows (Can be labelled) to signify causality.

# Conventions:
- Don't label arrows unless it's really important
- The structure is Cause -> Effect.
	- You can either use a sequential approach or have loops.
- Don't put blobs around phrases

# Guidelines:
- You boil things done to a root, often you work backwards, starting at the main problem and branching out and out from there.
- Don't combine two factors into one, keep ideas atomic.
	- My example sort of screws this up a bit in the 3rd tier effects.
- Further guidelines are:
	- The diagram should only include one end-factor, unless other factors are related and are important to explain.
	- Arrows can be labelled.
	- Boxes are best avoided
	- Ensure that all links of causality are clear, add extra details if the link isn't clear.
	- You might need to provide extra evidence or points if the cause you are pointing to isn't so clear, e.g. if you want to say that system downtime is cause, say its because patches being misapplied and because of bugs.
		- Points can stand on their own, so its a judgement call.
