# Purpose:

The purpose of a multiple-cause diagram is to consider how events combine together to form a larger problem. They can identify feedback loops and get closer to the root issue of why things are happening.

Think of it as starting to untie a bundle of string.

# Elements:
- A title describing the purpose of the diagram.
- Phrases used to describe the event/states
- Arrows (Can be labelled) to signify causality.

# Conventions:
- Don't label arrows unless it's really important
- The structure is Cause -> Effect.
	- You can either use a sequential approach or have loops.
- Don't put blobs around phrases

# Guidelines:
- You boil things done to a root, often you work backwards, starting at the main problem and branching out and out from there.
- Don't combine two factors into one, keep ideas atomic.
	- My example sort of screws this up a bit in the 3rd tier effects.
