# Purpose:
To highlight the connection between related elements or concepts, to provide a visual summary of an incident.

# Elements:
- A title describing the purpose of the diagram.
- Central circle for the main theme or topic.
- Blobs/Ovals (not perfect circles) for sub-themes or sub-topics (optional).
- Branching sets of lines.
- Words on the lines or at the ends of the lines describing the various ideas you wish to incorporate.
- There are no arrows.
# Conventions:
- Put the main theme or topic as a keyword or phrase in a central circle.
- Perhaps put rings around other key sub-themes.
- Related ideas expressed in one or a few words are attached to lines radiating from this circle (or optionally from the sub-themes or sub-topics creating fans).
- Write words along the lines or ends of lines.
- The lines do not show directional links, just an association.
- Use different colours to highlight particular fans.

# Guidelines:
- Circle the topic of central idea, or give a visual indicator.
- The process of completing a spray diagram can be as followed
	- Write down a central idea, keep it in the centre and give it lots of space.
	- Identify branches from that idea that you want to explore, give them straight lines and consider if further branches link back to it.
	- Work freely, write down various ideas and then consider if they are the same idea.
	- If you get stuck, you can start with a new central keyword and create a secondary spray diagram and keep the original uncluttered.
