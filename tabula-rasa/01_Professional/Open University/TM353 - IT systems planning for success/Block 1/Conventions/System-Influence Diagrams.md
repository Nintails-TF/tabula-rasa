# Purpose:

A systems map shows components of a system and it's environment. They are useful on first deciding on what structure you should use for further modelling and communicating with others the system you've chosen to study.

**Influence diagrams are the same, but have arrows showing relationships between blobs.**

*(In other words, it'll likely be used in part of the EMA/TMA as an information gather stage.)*

System maps are used:
- To clarify or highlight thoughts/ideas for early analysis
- Decide upon structural elements for a more detailed diagram.
- Experimenting with different boundaries and different understanding and purposes of the system.
- Decide upon the level of your system. Where you are focussing in.
- Communicating the basic structure and purpose of the system that you are describing.
# Elements:

A systems diagram/map must have the following:
- A diagram title, specifying the system of interest.
- A system boundary
- System components represented by blob lines and described in short phrases or words within the boundary.
- Environmental components described in words or phrases as blobs outside of the boundary.
- **Don't link or show influence at this stage.**
# Conventions:
The key conventions to follow when producing a systems map is the following:
- Words are used to name each component of the system and the environment.
- Blobs can overlap only if some of the components are seen as common in the early stages.

# Guidelines:

- Title of the diagram must refer to what the system is for and what it's purpose is.
	- `A system to ...` - Think about the output.
- System boundary must be clear you can express this as a colour or as line.
	- Within the boundary, you hold the components of the system, this doesn't have to be a physical boundary for the system, but perhaps steps the organisation isn't willing to take at the moment.
- The environment is made up of objects that aren't part of the system, but can affect the operations of the system.
- Make sure that the spacing is solid.
- Drawing several different versions of the same map can be helpful to compare different ideas.
	- Practically speaking, It would be useful to compare your results to another person or LLM.

*Note that you would typically use circles for everything, but I find that this is a little cleaner, and gets the point across just fine.*
