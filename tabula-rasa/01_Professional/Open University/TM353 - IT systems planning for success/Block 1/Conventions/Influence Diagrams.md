# Purpose:
To depict the relationships and connections between components or concepts. Similar to spray diagrams but with out any central topic, this frequently creates a web of relationships.
# Elements:
- A title describing the purpose of the diagram
- Lines
- Blobs/Ovals
- Words describing connections
# Conventions:
- You can build the diagram around any point of focus or perspective you want to explore.
- Start off with the simplest diagram possible. Then add more relationships as necessary.
- Stop adding blobs or lines when no more relevant components or concepts are left to be discussed.
	- If the diagram is crowded, then condense components down into single components.
- Use doubled arrows to show two-way relationships rather than doubled headed arrows.
# Guidelines:
Similar to that of Influence diagrams.
