# 3. Introduction:

As previously mentioned, we've discussed systems in terms of hierarchies. Where systems are viewed as being interconnected subsystems together, each of which can be described as their own system with boundaries.

Viewing systems in this way is helpful, as you can apply traditional engineering approaches in this[[../Glossary#^SiRe-def|Scientifically Reductive]] way. This approach does make an assumption: that the structure is hierarchical to begin with.

But some highly interconnected systems composed of thousands or tens of thousands of sub-systems don't always fall into line with the traditional engineering model. As [Bullock and Cliff (2004)]([(PDF) Complexity and Emergent behavior in ICT systems](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/235409934_Complexity_and_Emergent_behavior_in_ICT_systems))

> A single point of overall control introduces problems which scale as the number of nodes in reporting within a hierarchy increase. Gathering data can lead to delays, noise, and uncertainty which can lead to incorrect actions or decisions being made at the top.

(Ensure that you know the difference between hierarchical systems *(Forest nature)* and viewing systems as hierarchical in nature (*Organisational job structure)*. As one relates to how a system actually is, and the other relates to a perspective rather than a concrete hierarchy.)

Various problems of design, management, maintenance, decommissioning, and IT interconnectedness. The following question is raised:

> Introducing a new component or connection in an attempt to improve a protocol or impose control. Is difficult to measure, predict, and understand. How can we ensure: reliability, usability, robustness, efficiency, effectiveness, security, and evolvability. Within a deeply interconnected system that all of us rely on? - **Bullock and Cliff** (2004)

In essence, when systems are tightly coupled, how can we ensure that the needs of the system are met? We could change one thing and cause a massive domino effect somewhere else in the system, which could compromise it.

The NHS digital transition is prime example of how we can have problems as systems scale:

> How effective can a digital NHS be deployed and run? Issues range from the technological (Managing and ensuring integrity of massive data sets), to sociotechnical (data protection issues, security, and trust) to social (overcoming the current culture with an entrenched user population) - **Bullock and Cliff** (2004)

Hence, we can see along with other technological innovations like IoT (Internet of Things) and Cloud computing. That systems are becoming more complex and harder to fully grasp and understand.

We can introduce other techniques and forms of system design to examine these deeply interconnected and massive systems. How mastery and understand of this complexity enables us to build better IT systems and increase successes and minimize failures.
## 3.0.1. IT Systems - from Networks to Complexity:

One of the main drivers of this complexity; is that more IT, organisational, and social systems have been and are continued to be networked together into larger configurations. This has happened for a few reasons, according to [Merali and McKelvey (2006):]([(PDF) Using Complexity Science to effect a paradigm shift in Information Systems for the 21st century](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220220756_Using_Complexity_Science_to_effect_a_paradigm_shift_in_Information_Systems_for_the_21st_century))

1. Advances in hardware and software have accelerated the growth and development of networks and the [[../Glossary#^NetEff-def|Network Effect]].
2. Technological advances that enhance the connectivity of bandwidth and connectivity. 
3. The growth of IT-enabled socio-economic networks and globalisation, where more players can access networks.
 
 Thus, organisations deal with a world that is more dynamic, complex, uncertain, and where actions can have unintended consequences. In the past, there would be no way to have this information, so you wouldn't have to concern yourself with it. Now you do - otherwise you are at a competitive disadvantage.

AI and machine learning have also accelerated the complexity of systems and networks as well.

Complexity and other ideas can be explored to develop, plan, and build better IT systems / generalist systems.

The view is that complex IT systems can be expressed through a ecological lens. As whilst Ecology is the science of how organisms interact with each other within a natural environment, we can apply this to artificially made systems or environments too.

# 3.1. Complexity:

[[../Glossary#^Com-def|Complexity]] and [[../Glossary#^Feedback-def|Feedback]] are used to describe both simple and complex systems. But **Complexity theory** seeks to consider the behaviour of systems that have a high level of [[../Glossary#^Interconn-def|Interconnectedness]] systems that show these details are:

- **Biological systems** - Like ant colonies, slime moulds, and mushrooms.
- **Physical systems** - Like oceans, weather, and forests.
- **Social systems** - Like political parties, corporations, friend groups.
- **Sociotechnical systems** - Like transportation networks, cities, and MMOs.
- **Complex IT systems** - Like Social media, Internet, and Telecommunications.

Complexity has different definitions depending on the various mediums like mathematics, computer science, natural, and social sciences. Just be vigilant when learning/discussing it.

Complexity within systems theory refers to: **Emergent behaviour from interconnected components**.
## 3.1.1. Simple, Complex, and Complicated Systems:

According to [Casti (1994)]([Complexification: Explaining a Paradoxical World Through the Science of Surprise - J. L. Casti - Google Books](https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Complexification.html?id=thsfAQAAIAAJ&redir_esc=y)), There are four main difference between complex and simple systems:

| Definition          | **Simple Systems**                                                                               | **Complex Systems**                                                                                 |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Predictability**  | Give rise to predictable or deducible behaviour                                                  | Give rise to unpredictable and counterintuative behaviour                                           |
| **Interactions**    | Involve small numbers of interacts between a small number of components with few feedback loops. | Involve large numbers of interactions between large numbers of components with many feedback loops. |
| **Control**         | Centralised control/decision making                                                              | Decentralised control/decision making                                                               |
| **Decomposability** | Decomposable                                                                                     | Non-deconmposable                                                                                   |

You can have technical or ecological complex systems, but complex social systems are interesting as they incorporate human agency and choice, as [Tanrivedri and Lim (2017)]([scholar.archive.org/work/3zcav2p3tvh3xjnsgs7sygl4c4](https://scholar.archive.org/work/3zcav2p3tvh3xjnsgs7sygl4c4)) discuss:

> Engineered complex systems like engines are designed to behave in pre-determined ways, reliably, consistently, and predictably. If unexpected behaviours or actions occur, they are assumed to be: defects, glitches, or accidents that need to be fixed. However; In complex social systems human agents who are diverse, intelligent, and adaptive. They observe stimuli from each other and the wider environment. They learn, change, and adapt responses. Human agents can operate autonomously and pursue their own interests whilst breaking or undermining the rules of the system. The complexity level of an ecosystem increases with the level of diversity, adaptiveness, connectedness, and mutual dependencies. Neither the interactions of a social system are well understood and controls. Meaning outcomes are emergent, surprising, and unpredictable.

As IT systems are sociotechnical, they fall within this space of social complex systems as described above. AI technologies can also be viewed as agents, these agents are being integrated into IT systems. The AI is a technical component but also "human" component too.

Don't underestimate simple systems, car engines are very well designed and have many moving parts. In addition, within many complicated systems, it's very challenging to determine all inner relationships between components. 

System failure can occur because of **unprogrammed functionality**, in that a software system performs behaviours that the system wasn't designed to do. Component interactions, Organizational context and AI agents can contribute to this.
## 3.1.2. Complexity at the "Edge of Chaos":

An alternative approach to understanding complexity involves contrasting between fixed/static periodic regular behaviour or [[../Glossary#^chaos-def|Chaotic]] behaviour. 

The behaviour of complex systems swings between periodic to chaotic contexts, this refers to the four classes of behaviour as represented by Stephen Wolfram and Christopher Langton:
![[../../../../03_Reference/Pictures/Pasted image 20251129131917.png]]
*Class 1 (Fixed), Class 2 (Periodic), Class 3 (Chaotic), Class 4 (Complex)*

The **Butterfly Effect** means that the non-deterministic behaviour can approach a tipping point. Which results in [[../Glossary#^Bif-def|Bifurcation]] which results in a transition between states, these small [[../Glossary#^Pert-def|Perturbations]] results in a force that moves the system into a new phase transition. This can result within construction or destruction can occur within this space. The Complex space is frequently called the [[../Glossary#^EoC-def|Edge of Chaos.]]

Creativity is understood within this context as: "The production of structures that can survive and propagate for a long time." This has implications for IT systems in forms of resilience and lifespan, what we can do to is to ensure that our systems are robust and adaptive to combat the potential of changing environments.

IT systems may not operate within Class 4 (Complex), but may be within Class 3 (Chaotic). What this means is that we need a different strategy. Within chaos, we have the "edge of discontinuity" where current structures dissolve and new ones rise. The probability of failure here is very high.

[Tanrivedri and Lim (2017)]([scholar.archive.org/work/3zcav2p3tvh3xjnsgs7sygl4c4](https://scholar.archive.org/work/3zcav2p3tvh3xjnsgs7sygl4c4)) identify that various signs of discontinuity as:

1. **Critical slowing** - an IT systems becomes unable to handle small perturbations as it approaches the edge of discontinuity.
2. **Diminishing Returns** - an IT system declines in performance measures, such as efficiency, robustness, or accuracy.
3. **Disruption** - A new entry of agents into an existing or emerging IT system.

This is an interesting model, but it can only take us so far without considering additional factors.
## 3.1.3 Linearity and Non-linearity:

Within a linear system, the net output at a given place and time caused by two or more inputs is the sum of the outputs which would have caused each input. 

For example: Pushing a swing - if one arm adds 4 units of force and another adds 5, you gain `X+Y`, and you push the swing with 9 units of force.

Within [[../Glossary#^LinSys-def|Linear Systems]], this output is referred to as the [[../Glossary#^SupPos-def|Superposition.]] Within linear systems, we can just sum the inputs or analyse the inputs and figure out a result. Once we understand the parts of a linear system within isolation, we can achieve a full understand of the whole system. If we study modules in isolation, we can learn everything we need to know about an IT system.

With [[../Glossary#^NonLin-def|Non-Linear Systems]] the net output doesn't obey the the law of superposition. Even if we could break systems into small constituent parts, even if we could reach a complete understanding of parts in isolation, it doesn't help us figure out the whole understanding of the position. 

**Non-linear systems highlight that the parts aren't key, but the interactions between systems themselves are of critical importance.**

What this means for IT systems, is that as they become more complex and diverse. They become increasingly difficult to understand, manage, and predict how they will behave. **Non-linearity** in this way impacts IT systems profoundly.

The idea is that [[../Glossary#^Sim-def|Simulation]] is frequently used to actually understand, predict, and model IT systems. AI systems involves agents which can both adapt and learn within IT systems.
## 3.1.4. Complexity and System Failure:

One of the main reasons for IT systems, is that IT systems are perceived as not being successful as that complex systems are merely scaled-up versions of simple systems. We then can view systems in terms of being dynamic rather than static.

One way of understanding systems, is that we can figure out how the plan successful systems, we minimise the possibility of failures. We need to understand systems, so that we can prevent destructive causes.

A few key points here is that:

1. Top-level control is increasingly impossible. If we try to control large-scale systems that have large number of highly-connected components, we can endanger the system and produce failure.
	1. IT system thinkers, say that some level of control is required, such as in start-ups. That instead of fully-controlling systems, that you nudge or steer it towards Category 4 (Complexity) rather than Chaos.
2. But, when an IT system reaches a state of Chaos, the possibility of bifurcation into a new system emerges. So it may be necessary to redefine an IT system with a new structure or roles.
