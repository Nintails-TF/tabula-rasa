# 1. Introduction:

Success and failure are two sides of the same coin in IT systems. In order to produce high quality systems we need to consider the following:

1. How to plan systems for success and how critical success is in it systems. Consequently, we need to look at failures as well.
	1. What is our definition of success? How does that look different for a wide range of stakeholders.
	2. How do we win/lose, as a systems designer?
2. Why IT systems are always sociotechnical and what does this mean? Why are all IT systems sociotechnical.
	1. e.g. Different groups interact with the system, different people have opinions on the system, people need to fund or maintain the system, etc.
3. How can we model IT systems using system design concepts and techniques.
	1. Practically, how do we display and use the knowledge about system design.
	2. System diagrams are key here.

# 1.1. The Importance of Success and Failure in IT Systems.

IT systems are used to describe the systems at play, *software* doesn't full encapsulate these ideals. This is for two main factors:

1. Business or Organisational IT solutions are often a mix of hardware, software, networks, cloud, and other technical systems.
2. IT systems also include human, cultural, and organisational factors too.

> IT systems are not just software, but are hardware, organisational, and human systems.

Another core idea, is that what is meant by success and failure within IT systems. This answer depends on who you talk to within the chain of system design. A project manager cares if the system is completed in time and on budget, a programmer cares if the code is high-quality and the system runs well, an end user cares if the system helps them with their job.

For now, the following definitions are enough:

**Successful IT systems** are systems that meets the needs of the organisation or company as well as other relevant stakeholders that are related to the organisation but may be external.

**Failed IT systems** are systems that do not meet the needs of stakeholders within and org and doesn't help other key stakeholders.

Large IT systems failures are often talked about, but designing small systems well is also critical as the pave the road and act as a platform in which greater systems can be launched. In the public sector, large failures get massive press. In private if a system works well, it gets published if it does poorly then it is forgotten.

## Case Studies of Success and Failure within IT Systems:

### Success - Mitchells and Butlers:

M&B is a pub brand chain, but the IT systems were outdated and struggling after a growth. A new acquisition signalled change.

Over a five-year course, the company did the following:

- Moved their infrastructure to the cloud to be all in once place ran by Fujitsu.
- Created a data store to collect more data and present it to the head office within minutes.
- All the hardware running on mid-tier IBM servers was either virtualized and ported or scrapped and migrated.
- They worked with EquaTerra on how to benchmark the system. Enabling them to figure out capabilities before hand and running costs.
- All elements of IT systems were condensed down into 6 factors: *data centre, network, outlets, end-users, central services, and applications.*
	- The outputs of each area was looked at, and they figured out what they wanted to focus on first.
- The data centre and network were prioritised first, as they were the backbone that supported the whole system.
- They standardised payroll systems, human resources, property systems for each bar or end-user.
	- They provided tweaks and changes in edge-cases.

### Failures - BBC Digital Media Initiative:

The BBC DMI was an £100m bust. It intended to make the digital archive tapeless.

From 2007 to 2013, the project did the following:

- A production system linked to the BBC broadcasting archive didn't function as intended. Reporters couldn't get access to old archive media to use for their reports and news articles.
	- They had to drive around in taxis with old tape recordings from office to office.
- The money wasn't spent carefully and considerately, money was being thrown around.
- The scope of the project was too big and got out of hand.
- John Linwood the CTO is being kicked out temporarily and had previously worked at Microsoft and Yahoo.
	- He was being paid well, and had a bonus last year.
- An issue with the system was that much of the software used could only be used if the system was fully completed.
- PrincewaterhouseCoopers is investigating what went wrong in terms of project management, control, and governance.  
- Tools and systems were made by private corporations that could of done heavy lifting for the system, but weren't used.
- The systems that were developed, Fabric archive database, was far slower than existing libraries that used tape copies.
- No technology was delivered from 2008-2009 and the funding contract was terminated, the BBC then brought the project in-house. But couldn't make the project profitable.

### Differences - Why Did M&B Succeed and BBC Fail:

The three main differences were the following:

1. B&M worked with other organisations and got them to fulfil tasks that they couldn't do. The BBC DMI did not leverage new tools or systems.
2. B&M produced more modular systems that could get off the ground and help stakeholders right away with data centre and network operations being focused on first. The BBC DMI only worked if the whole project succeeded, which resulted in poor deliverables.
3. B&M had better sociotechnical practices in place, which resulted in higher quality decisions being made. BBC DMI had poor leadership and sociotechnical practices.

The learning opportunities are:

- Bespoke systems carry additional technical debt and risk, if other existing tools can help, use them. The public sector can often demand these without understanding the drawbacks.
- Organisational structure and practices matter a huge amount. Departments working together rather than technical folk working in isolation, working with other companies to come to solutions.
	- Maintaining trust and success with stakeholders is very important, give them some wins whilst the product is compounding, and they'll remain happy and cooperative. Make their work harder and make them struggle and cooperation and trust will dry up.
- Waterfall methods require very diligent understanding of scope and clear deadlines and timelines, they can carry great amounts of risk if the management or leadership keeps promising more and more.
	- There must be ruthless prioritisation on what a system does and what is important to stakeholders.

### Conclusion:

Case studies offer a great insight into developing your own processes into designing quality systems, by looking and the successes and failures and why they happened. You can leverage strengths and minimize weaknesses.

**Activity -** Look at another two case studies, one of success and one of failure and talk about it in the group form.
