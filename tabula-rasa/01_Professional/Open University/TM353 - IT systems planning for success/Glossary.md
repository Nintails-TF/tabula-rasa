# Glossary

Any bold words, enter them here:

- **Systems thinking** - A set of components interconnected for a purpose. ^st-def
	1. A system is an assembly of components connected together in an organised way.
	2. The components are affected by being in the system and are changed if they leave it.
	3. The assembly does something - carries out a task, fulfils a function.
	4. **The assembly as a whole has identified by some observer who is interested in it.**
- **Sociotechnical** - IT systems cannot be understood or designed without both considering social aspects (organisational and people) as well as technical aspects (hardware and software). ^SoTech-def
- **Evolutionary** - IT systems are flexible and fluid they incrementally evolve and change over time as organisations, people, and technical abilities change. ^evo-def
- **Technology** - Technology concerns itself with understanding how knowledge is creatively applied to organised tasks involving people and machines that meet sustainable goals. ^tech-def
- **Boundary** - What a system cannot or should not do. ^Bo-def
- **Environment** - Factors that influence a system or that a system influences that are outside of the system. ^Env-def
- **Open Systems** - A system that interact and exchange information with its environment, rather than operating in isolation. ^OS-def
- **Sub-systems** - A system within an already existing system. e.g. An MMO will have a PvP, PvE, Trading, social, guild, sub-systems. ^subSys-def
- **Hierarchy** - A structure in which people/systems/ideas are ranked according to their authority, level of importance or complexity. ^Hier-def
- **Emergence** - The idea that the whole is greater than the sum of it's parts. ^Em-def
- **Successful System** - A system that achieved what was intended, was operational at the time and cost that was planned, the project team and users are satisfied with the result and continue to be happy afterwards. ^SucSys-def
- **Stakeholder** - Any group or individual who can affect or is affect by the achievement of the organization's objectives. ^Stakeholder-def
- **Power** - Power is the ability to achieve one's goals, particularly by influencing others or controlling resources. Sources include hierarchical position, social capital, specialized skills, and access to material resources. ^Power-def
- **Structures** - What is the source of power from a person, is it social, economical, cultural, technological, etc? ^Struc-def
- **Politics** - The dynamic processes through which stakeholders with differing interests negotiate, compete, and collaborate to influence system boundaries, resource allocation, and decision-making authority, shaped by power structures and emerging from the interaction between social and technical components of the system. ^Poli-def
- **Systems failures Approach** - Is an analytical framework for understanding organizational and project failures by examining breakdowns across multiple interconnected system layers rather than attributing problems to single causes or individuals. ^SFA-def
- **Scientific Reductionism** - Seeking understanding through splitting systems or phenomena into their smallest constituent parts and explaining high level behaviour using the lower-level mechanisms. ^SiRe-def
- **Network Effect** - The phenomenon that if more people use a system or a product, it gains in value or becomes more useful. Think, telephone networks as a prime example. ^NetEff-def
- **Complexity** - Complexity refers to the number and the nature of interconnectedness between system components. A complex system would have: Many interacting parts, Non-linear relationships, Emergent behaviours that cannot be predicted, multiple levels of organisation or hierarchy. ^Com-def
	- Complex system are different than complicated system. A jet engine is complicated, but follows a simple and predictable system. A social network or ecosystem is complex with unpredictable and emergent properties.
- **Feedback** - Feedback refers to how a system's output loop back to influence its inputs, creating circular feedback/causality. There are two main types: ^Feedback-def
	- **Positive Feedback** - Amplifies change, a microphone feeding back into itself, or a network effect; more users attract more users. This can drive explosive growth or collapse.
	- **Negative Feedback** - Counteracts change, price increases to reduce demand, or a body regulates temperature. This drives stability and self-regulation.
- **Interconnectedness** - Interconnectedness refers to the density and pattern of relationship between a system's components and its environment. ^Interconn-def
	- **Direct and indirect links** - A may effect B directly, but also indirectly through C, D, and E. Think of a child being disciplined in a family, it directly effects one child, but the other children also are effected.
	- **Coupling Strength** - How tightly or loosely connected different parts are. Tight couples mean that change happens and propagates quickly. Loose couples mean that change is slower and has more of a buffer.
	- **Network Topology** - The patterns of how the network or connects are setup. (Centralised vs Distributed, Hierarchical vs Flat, Clustered vs Dispersed). 
		- For example: Centralised means there is a hub of information, where as distributed means that information is spread across nodes.
- **Chaotic** - A system that is highly sensitive to initial conditions, this makes long term predictions impossible. These systems are non-bounded and are deterministic but unpredictable.^chaos-def
- **Bifurcation** - A fork in the road which changes a systems behaviour. For example: If you decide to rush a project, it may result in the current system to move from fixed, or periodic, or chaotic, or to complex. ^Bif-def
- **Perturbation** - A perturbation is a small disturbance, that results in a deviation from a system's current state or goal. A stable and resilient system will be protected, but a system near a point of bifurcation point, may result in major shifts. ^Pert-def
	- For instance, a hurricane caused by the flaps of a butterfly wing. Because all of the conditions of a hurricane was already in motion.
- **Edge of Chaos** - The edge of chaos is the region between **Periodic** and **Chaotic** points. It is **Complex** behaviour, within the points of order and disorder - lies creativity. ^EoC-def
- **Superposition** - The principle that in linear systems, the combined effect of multiple inputs equals the sum of their individual effects. If A produces X and B produces Y, then A+B produces X+Y.^SupPos-def
- **Linear systems** - Systems where outputs are directly proportional to inputs and superposition holds. Doubling input doubles output, and effects simply add together. Predictable and mathematically simple.^LinSys-def
- **Non-linear systems** - Systems where outputs are NOT proportional to inputs. Small changes can cause large effects (or vice versa), superposition breaks down, and behaviours like feedback loops, chaos, and tipping points emerge. Most real-world systems are non-linear.^NonLin-def
- **Simulation** - A model that emulates a real system's behaviour over time, rather than studying the actual system over time. You create a simplified version and run it to see what happens. ^Sim-def
