## Key Assessment Principles

### Critical Success Factors

1. **Use case study evidence exclusively**
   - Every claim must reference Aliaj (2025) or Maru (2025)
   - No external research required or expected
   - Don't invent facts

2. **Apply concepts correctly**
   - Show understanding of Block 1 theory
   - Correct application to case study
   - Proper use of terminology

3. **Critical analysis required**
   - Don't just describe
   - Analyze, evaluate, justify
   - Show critical thinking

4. **Diagrams provide genuine insight**
   - Not just decoration
   - Must reveal understanding
   - Properly constructed
   - Well explained

5. **Word limits are strict**
   - Exceeding may lose marks
   - Count carefully
   - Edit ruthlessly

6. **Rationale is essential**
   - For every diagram: explain thinking process
   - For choices: justify decisions
   - Show your reasoning

7. **Multiple perspectives**
   - Consider different stakeholders
   - Recognize competing views
   - Show systems thinking

8. **Principles matter**
   - Q3 must reference Part 3 principles explicitly
   - Show how principles relate to case study
   - Connect theory to practice
