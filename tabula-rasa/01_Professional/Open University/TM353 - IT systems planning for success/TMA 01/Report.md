## Question 1: Successful IT Systems (30 marks)

### Part (a) - Spray Diagram or Rich Picture (10 marks)

![[../../../../03_Reference/Pictures/TMA01-spray-diagram-final.png]]

**Rationale and Insights**:
I've chosen this approach to building a spray diagram, as when working through various pieces of material, I found the Figure 2.4. that depicted the Post Office Horizon failure to be very readable. I decided to include details about how key stakeholders such as customer and staff where effected, highlighting the stress and anxiety felt by both parties. 

The core insight was that the system failure was catastrophic because it occurred across 3 different domains (technical, temporal, social/cultural). e.g. The mainframe bug was the catalyst, it happened during tax season, Barclay's didn't learn from previous incidents.
