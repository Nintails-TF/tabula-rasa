# Job Search Strategy:

## What Are the Strategies?:

How are you looking for jobs and what are you doing?

- Indeed, Gov.uk, Regional jobs,
- Careers fairs and events (face to face and online)
- Graduate opportunities
- Social media
- University career services

It's good to mix between public and private job markets. Sometimes more or less can be within hidden spheres. Who you know can matter more that what you know in certain industries.

## Hidden Job Market:

Most employers prefer to recruit within their current network or network of current employees who can vouch for them. So:

- Internal promotions.
- Mutuals and contacts.
- Recommendations from trusted people.
- Reaching directly out to companies about jobs.

It's costly for employers to recruit and post things online, so if you can reduce that, you gain an edge. So contact people who aren't actively searching.

Recruitment agencies also place people into positions. 

 **What do employers think is the most effective method to get strong candidates?:**
1. Using personal contacts
2. Advertising online
3. Recruitment agencies.

## Opportunity Hub:

The OUs vacancy hub contains various opportunities for a wide range of services, events, and such.

Worth looking at. 

**How could I get experience or knowledge built up for the cybersecurity field or IT technology as a whole. The goal is to be a SOC analyst.**


## Job Search Strategies:

- Research organisations you want to work for.
	- When do they recruit
	- What agencies do they use
	- What do they value
	- What do they sell
- Certain industries recruit more informally.
- Being selective and focussed.
	- When the job market is hard, you can't spray and pray.
- Hidden and active job market.
- Confidence in yourself
- Employers market versus Employees market
	- Make it as easy as possible.
	- Mirroring - express the companies values in your own terms.
- Make a nuisance of yourself.
	- Call in and speak to people.

Recruitment agencies can give valuable information about the state of the labour market or what is going on or happening? You are just a product to them ideally, you might get send to other places you don't want to go.

You mentioned something interesting just a second ago, what exactly is an employers market versus an employee market. Why are we in and employer's market?

Employer’s Market: 

This happens when there are more job seekers than available jobs. 

Employers have the upper hand because: They can be more selective. 

They often offer lower salaries or fewer benefits since demand for jobs is high. 

Job seekers compete harder for fewer positions. 

Employee’s Market: This occurs when there are more jobs than qualified candidates. 

Employees have leverage because: Companies compete for talent. Salaries, benefits, and flexibility tend to increase. Job seekers can negotiate better terms.
## Networking:

Quality connections can pay dividends more than the quantity of them. Make it easier for people to find you.

Different perspectives can be useful to understand how different industries operate and how they are similar or different.

### How to Network Effectively:

- Physical networking
- Employee Referral Schemes
- Joining Professional bodies can work well.
	- ISC2
- Digital networking
- Get information and perspective on these matters.
	- Be curious and open-minded.

### Building Networks:

**Keep the relationship hot** - Don't stop talking to them and discussing things with them.

Look at OU alumni, search for fields and give them messages, ask them about things.

Many employers use recruitment via linked in to quickly get people.

How did they get where they are. What did they do.

Who you are, what your strengths are, what you are looking for. What your call to action is? (Connect on linked in, signpost to people, business card)

How can I find people who are good at what I want to do?

Skills based CV can be a good approach.
Contact the careers service from the OU and look around it.
