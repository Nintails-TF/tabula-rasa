# Networking From Woe to Pro:

**Jackie Pickles** - Career and Employability Officer - Added linked in.
## What is Networking:

- Finding advice from people in the industry.
- Meeting people in an industry.
- Marketing yourself towards employers.
	- Describing your value.

**Definitions:**
- *The exchange of information and contacts for professional or social purpose.*
	- How can someone help you and how can you help them, reciprocity and helping others is key. **At least, displaying it.**
- *Meeting people who may be useful to know.*
- *Building relationships with others to help your career develop.*

Building network can take time and energy, relationships aren't built in a day.

Many people deal with internal self-talk:
- Hate being fake
- Don't like being manipulative
- Don't want to waste time, theirs or others.

It's a way of gaining information and sharing your expertise. I think a big issue is translating your expertise from one language to another, e.g. if you are mathematician, it can be difficult to describe your value to an author.

30% of people tend to reach out to an email or linked in message. So you can play the numbers game and learn from them or gain experience, you can let them know about what you are able to do.

If you already know people or bits and pieces about them you can make contact easier. 

- Access the hidden job market.
	- 50% of jobs aren't listed publicly, headhunting, word of mouth, references.
- Focus on opening doors, chance encounters.

*The idea is that networking isn't just a thing that you do for a job, but it is a life skill. But personality also plays a big factor here, let's say if you were a more shy or introverted person - not exactly charismatic, what methods would work best for you with networking?*

*I know that I'm better in writing text since I have some time to formulate my thoughts.*

**Answer:** Talk over text or messages through linked in. Don't ask for something, but that you are interested in people and there is an exchange.

How much time should you devote to networking. CPD events, connecting with all the members - Offer to help people out first.
