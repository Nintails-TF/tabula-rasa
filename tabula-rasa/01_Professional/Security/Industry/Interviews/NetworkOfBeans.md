# NetworkOfBeans (Derrick):

- How you got started
	- 7 years ago - PHD program - cognitive psychology
		- Learning and LLMs, human memory and learning.
		- Programming and software developing on the side.
	- Security - what do I tolerate and what can I do.
		- Pen testing - OSCP at home.
		- OSCP was very hard.
		- Internship - AWD security -> F secure -> UK branch now.
		- Consulting - Good to start with.
			- Auditing work - Consulting - Checkboxes and meet sure they meet a list.
			- Pen testing - Regulatory requirement for banks, web add and network tests.
				- 3-10 Days generally, longer term would be months.
				- Network test or Application test.
				- Test what you've been given with a scope.
			- Web app tests are 50:50 and network tests are very easy to break.
		- Another company - Rapid7
			- Metasploit - 2 year tenure - remote.
			- Good company, fun to work for.
			- Doing the same thing over and over again. 
		- Internally for a bank
			- Better work life balance
			- Silver handcuffs
				- Very comfortable money.
			- Consulting builds the best technical skills.
				- Learn more as well.
			- Developers moving from software to cybersecurity
				- Interesting, unique perspective. OK skills.
				- Very mid skills.
				- Developers fix things well but suck at breaking, whilst Consultants break things well but suck at fixing.
			- Breaking with consulting is more sexy. Recognising things.
			- Test APIs from Postman all day long.
			- You find smaller things aspects.
- Consulting or Internships are good for Pen testing
	- 3-6 months if they like you they give an offer.
	- London, Edinburgh, Glasgow, etc.
	- Waldo - Polish (f-secure/NCC group - any postings?)
- NCC group
	- Associate would be entry or first step
	- Everything else beyond that.
- Research around Pen testing in the UK
	- Scope out company
	- Pen testing, penetration testing, offensive security, red teaming, OSCP, cyber security consulting.
	- Red team = Attacking without knowledge, Pen testing = Attacking with knowledge.
		- Red teaming means they wouldn't want to make noise. Advanced niche of pen testing.
- Get the first job, and then degree becomes a checkbox.
- Burp suite certification - Looks very good and is very cheap.
	- Show that you are interested in offensive security work and some knowledge of skills.
	- OWASP Zap is a meme-tool. 
	- Very appealing to businesses and cheap.
- Get bored easily - the skill curve - once you master it, becomes turbo-nerds through malware analysis.
	- All the money is within Pen-testing.
- Cybersecurity Pen testing aspects
	- Not any more money, unless you move into leadership.
	- You get to the top-end and then you get capped.
	- Once you get good, gets easy enough.
