- **EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response)**
	- EDR is security software that is installed on endpoints that monitors, detects, records, and responds to threats within endpoints. ^EDR-def
	- EDRs generate very detailed logs for specific machines/endpoints.
	- EDRs differ from antivirus, as they are behaviour based and not signature based, meaning they can flag or take action against unknown threats if the activity is strange.
- MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication)
- CIA Triad
	- Confidentiality
	- Integrity

- Incident Recovery Process:
	- Containment
	- Eradication
	- Recovery
- **IDS (Intrusion Detection Systems) / IPS (Intrusion Prevention Systems)**
	- Both of these monitor network traffic for suspicious activity. But the IDS will watch and report, where as an IPS will block threats in real time. ^IDS-IPS-def
		- IPS can result in false-positives that disrupt legitimate traffic if not configured well.
	- IDS is a security camera, IPS is a security guard.
		- If IDS spots port scanning, then it generates an alert so a SOC team can look at it. If an IPS spots port scanning, it can block the source IP right away.
- Firewall
- WAF (Web Application Firewall)
- **SIEM (Security Information and Event Management)**
	- SIEMs collect information from across a network in real time, and alerts on potential incidents so that they can be reviewed. ^SIEM-def
	- SIEMs collect data from various sources (firewalls, servers, endpoints, applications, etc) and aggregate them together for easier analysis.
	- SIEMs are useful in alerting SOC analysts for suspicious patterns and anomalies.
	- SIEMs are very helpful in legal compliance, as they provide audit trails - showing who, when, and what happened. 
- **Endpoint** 
	- An endpoint is any device that connects with a network that can send or receive data. You can think of them as a moat of your network. ^endpoint-def
		- Some points are deeper or more shallow.
	- Typical endpoints are: PCs (Laptops, Desktops), Smartphones (Tablets, Phones), Servers, IoT devices (Smart cameras, printers, sensors), and POS systems.
	- Endpoints can be operated by humans and by autonomous systems.
- **Point-of-sale (POS) systems**
	- POS systems are the hardware and software setup where customers complete transactions. These are the checkout systems where payments are processed and sales are finalized. ^POS-definition
	- These are high-value endpoints because they carry credit card details, customer payment info, and transaction records.
		- Tablet-based systems, card readers, cash registers, self-payment kiosks, etc.
	- They are often vulnerable as they run outdated software, are physically accessible, and are connected with a broader network.
- **SOC (Security Operations Centre)**
	- An essential facility that houses a team of information security workers responsible for continuously monitoring and evaluating an organizations security status. ^SOC-def
	- The main job of a SOC team is to identify, examine, and address cybersecurity incidents by using technology solutions and procedures.
- Threat Intelligence
	- Threat Intelligence is actionable information about current or emerging threats that help make informed security decisions. In other words: *What are attackers doing out in the wild? So you can block it before it happens to you.* ^Threat-intelligence-def
	- You can have different types of threat intel - strategic, tactical, operational, and technical.
	- Threat intelligence informs threat hunting.
- Threat Hunting.
	- Threat Hunting involves searching through infrastructure and networks for threats that have evaded existing security services. ^Threat-hunting-def
		- They can either operate under the assumption of compromise ("Assume a breach, act as if attackers are in.") or operate without assuming breach ("What are our blind spots, what paths are we not monitoring?")
	- This process is creative, hypothesis-driven, and can uncover unknown threats or potential threats.
		- So test what attackers would want to do, and see if automated tooling catches it, if it doesn't build a rule or inform people who can make a rule.
- Telnet
- Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)
- Directory Brute Forcing
	- A reconnaissance technique where attackers systematically test a web server for hidden or unlinked directories and files by sending automated requests for common directory/file names. ^DBF-def
		- Common targets: `/admin`, `/backup`, `/config`, `/uploads`
		- Tools: Gobuster, Dirb, Dirbuster, ffuf
		- Defence: Proper authentication, remove unnecessary directories, rate limiting, monitor for sequential 404 patterns
- Wordlist
	- A text file containing words or phrases (one per line) that automated tools use to systematically test possibilities. ^wordlist-def
	- Size determines coverage vs. speed:
		- Small (`common.txt`): ~4K entries, fast reconnaissance
		- Medium: ~220K entries, thorough enumeration
		- Large: Maximum coverage, slower scans
	- Used across multiple techniques:
		- Directory brute forcing, password cracking, subdomain enumeration, username enumeration, fuzzing
	- Can be customized using OSINT, target-specific terminology, or industry terms
- Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)
- User Datagram Protocol (UDP)
- Rsync 
	- A utility for transferring files between a computer and external hard-drive across a network. Written in C, it's lightweight and uses minimal network resources. ^Rsync-def
	-
