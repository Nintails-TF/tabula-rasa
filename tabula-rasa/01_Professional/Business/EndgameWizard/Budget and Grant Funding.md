Andy Robinson:

Background: Technology companies with building, growing, and scaling. Working with engineers, software, and such. How we test and take something new to market, bleeding edge engineering, etc.

Using AI tools. Cursor AI - talk to it and write code. Write using AI etc. 

Do we understand why we are building something
Why we are building it
How do we make profit from it.
How do you test ideas.
What does the market look like
What is the strategy

Duolingo Versus Chess.com | Applying the Duolingo technique to the Chess.com method.
Netflix VS Blockbuster.

Macro, what is going in the market:
Do some research, into the big players, who are the dominant players, who are the niche players, How do I do one part. How do you map this out and figure this out entirely.

Dump everything I know into a page. What is going on and where are the gaps. Using Deep research, functions and generate reports for x, y and z.

See how big something is. Use things such as headcounts and money.
Find a solution or idea, and figure out what is lacking and if it's something frustrated.
Don't design something for yourself. You don't know everything, go and find people who and what are the frustrations.
Don't assume I know everything - The "Mom" test. If you ask your mum about your business idea, she'll lie to you. Ask questions that don't lead to answers you are expecting. Would they actually pay for something.
Design tools or questions that you'll design for my chess club. 

Collect user data or any information's or data. How do you prove that people care and how do you know? 

What is the customer problem? How do other customers understand this problem. Look at signals, proof, understanding, and purpose.

How to be even more right about what is being suggested?

Prompt tuning. Looking for signals not perfection, move quickly figure out the wedge.
Where you spend your time, and resources, and such. Talking to real paying customers. Opportunity cost and such. How to pivot and place resources.

Being very clear on scope and what matters. How do I talk to customers and ask questions.

Market research through Scottish public research service.

Make a technical decision, when you have plan make a technical decision. Look at customer information where as also looking, Ask questions about your customer and how they feel first before making decisions.

Where is the wedge:
Do one thing better than another conglomerate.

Be wrong, and learn from it quickly. 

Feature parity - Building something new, you can't compete by trying to catch up with someone. 
Trying to get people to move away from a bigger platform.

Balancing time, build a prototype and ask customer.

Record conversations, then reflect about them and such.
