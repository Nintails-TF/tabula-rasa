- It's hard to beat modernity, since you've got to operate within it. The best move is to leverage it without being crushed by it. Which is revolution through discipline.
	- To use a smartphone, without forcing yourself to use a flip-phone. Don't spend your resources on the junk-heap of endless social-media slop.

- Freedom is only bought with discipline, if you aren't disciplined and do what you need to do, you will only suffer.
	- Taking positive steps forward even when hard, always beats taking negative steps backwards even when easy/fun/pleasurable.
		- As people, we find it easy to justify the 2nd, especially when tired, weak, or drained.

- The world and it's people are results-oriented whilst they preach about the process. Focus on your own processes: act civil, kind, and approachable whilst building fearsome strengths, weapons, and wealth. Through a disciplined and systematic process.
	- The truth of the matter, is that people can't/don't want to see beyond the surface, there may be a few who do care, this is very rare. Even amongst family/lovers.
		- This is not because they are evil, but because they are human.

- Build systems you control well; navigate broken/inefficient systems wisely; know the difference.
	- Complete insulation is impossible - your sphere inevitably intersects with broader dysfunction.
	- Some broken/inefficient systems do respond to pressure; pre-deciding "nothing can change" can become a self-fulfilling prophecy
	- Occasionally you'll have unusual leverage or low-cost opportunities to improve systems beyond your immediate control - stay alert to exceptions.

- **I'm going to beat you and you won't even understand how.**
	- Velvet Glove - softness on the surface, steel underneath.
		- Aerodynamic coating to navigate through a messy world at high speed.
		  
		  
- Language learning in the future will be amazing to do.
	- Want to learn one before 30, ideally two.
