# Tim Duncan

"Good, better, best. Never let it rest. Until your good is better and your better is best."

## My Competitive Ideal:

What about the idea of building a competitor within an eSport or sport where the idea is not about being flashy, or excellent. But drilling fundamentals and doing the boring thing correct and raising the baseline floor high enough so that people need to play out of their mind to outperform or need to break the rules and fundamentals.

e.g. You squeeze and constrict your opponents with solid fundamental play, forcing them to mechanically perform at a high level or fundamentals better.

What about a more purist Tim Duncan-esc approach, not the complete absence of creativity, but being the stone or the pillar within a team to give space for creativity or talent to rise from within your team?
