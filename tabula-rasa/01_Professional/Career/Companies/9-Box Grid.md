# 9-Box Grid Method for High-Potential Identification

## What is the 9-Box Grid?

The 9-box grid is a talent management tool that plots employees on two axes:
- **X-axis:** Current performance (low, moderate, high)
- **Y-axis:** Future potential (low, moderate, high)

This creates nine categories, allowing organisations to differentiate between strong performers who may have limited growth capacity and those with significant potential for advancement.

|                        | Low Performance                   | Moderate Performance              | High Performance            |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------- | --------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| **High Potential**     | Potential gem (needs development) | High potential (emerging talent)  | Star (future leader)        |
| **Moderate Potential** | Inconsistent (question mark)      | Core employee (solid contributor) | High performer (key talent) |
| **Low Potential**      | Underperformer (action needed)    | Average contributor (maintain)    | Specialist (valued expert)  |

## How the 9-Box is Tracked

| Method                         | Description                                                                                                                                                     |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Talent management software** | Platforms like Workday, SAP SuccessFactors, Oracle HCM, or Lattice include built-in 9-box functionality with visualisation, historical tracking, and reporting. |
| **Spreadsheets**               | Smaller organisations compile manager assessments manually and update periodically.                                                                             |
| **Calibration sessions**       | Managers meet to discuss and debate placements, ensuring consistency across departments and surfacing hidden talent.                                            |
| **Longitudinal tracking**      | Monitoring movement over time to validate whether identification criteria actually predict success.                                                             |

## Additional Factors That Influence High-Potential Success

| Factor                         | Why It Matters                                                                                                               |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Political savvy**            | Understanding organisational dynamics and navigating competing interests; often underweighted formally but highly predictive |
| **Visibility and sponsorship** | Having a senior advocate who actively promotes your career; high-potentials without sponsors often stall                     |
| **Timing and opportunity**     | Being in the right role when a gap opens; structural luck plays a larger role than formal systems acknowledge                |
| **Cultural fluency**           | Reading unwritten rules and knowing what the organisation actually rewards versus what it claims to value                    |
| **Resilience and recovery**    | How someone responds to failure or setback; real-world observation often reveals more than assessments                       |
| **Network breadth**            | Connections across functions and levels; predicts ability to lead cross-functional initiatives                               |
