# Visibility

Success at a job or workplace isn't about how well you do something, but how well you appear to do something. Visibility is more important then ability.

**The idea is to test what works and doesn't work within your environment and adapt accordingly.**

My nature means I'm less likely to aim for visibility, so it's something I'm going to need to focus on. e.g. I know I can bring value to people or to an organisation, they need to see that value though.


In essence an approach could be:
- **Documentation** – Written records of contributions, decisions made, problems solved. Useful in performance reviews and calibration discussions where your manager advocates on your behalf.
- **Strategic updates** – Brief, factual progress communications to relevant stakeholders. Framed around project outcomes rather than personal achievement.
- **Letting work artefacts speak** – Well-crafted reports, dashboards, or deliverables that carry your name create passive visibility without requiring you to talk about yourself.
- **Building advocates** – If self-promotion feels unnatural, cultivating relationships with people who will mention your contributions in rooms you're not in becomes critical. This requires helping others and being genuinely useful, which may align better with your instincts.
- **Choosing high-visibility projects** – Volunteering for work that inherently surfaces to leadership. The project does the visibility work for you.

The opposite, yet necessary path may be:
- **Claiming credit explicitly** – "I built that," "My analysis drove that decision," "I identified the problem and fixed it." Direct, unhedged ownership statements in meetings, emails, and conversations with leadership.
- **Stating ambitions openly** – Telling managers and senior leaders exactly what role they want, when they want it, and asking what they need to do to get there. No waiting to be noticed or tapped on the shoulder.
- **Inserting themselves into visible situations** – Volunteering to present, asking to attend senior meetings, requesting introductions to executives, positioning themselves on high-profile projects before being invited.
- **Narrating their own story** – Proactively framing their trajectory: "I've been building expertise in X, I led Y initiative, I'm now ready for Z." Repeating this narrative until it becomes how others describe them.
- **Asking directly for what they want** – Promotions, raises, opportunities, feedback, sponsorship. Not hinting. Asking.
- **Redirecting conversations to their contributions** – When discussions happen about projects or successes, ensuring their specific role is named and understood.
- **Building relationships instrumentally** – Connecting with people specifically because of their organisational influence, not just natural affinity.
