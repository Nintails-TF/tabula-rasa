# Leaders:

## Foundational Requirements:

**Core:** *Create a single strong impression, they won't see you often. They go off feel and tone more than managers.*
**Inverse:** *At least don't create a poor impression, better to be anonymous than disliked.*

- **Strategic thinking** - Connect the job details to business outcomes and profits. Why does doing X matter?
- **Brevity and Clarity** - They have limited time. Communicate crisply and clearly.
- **Composure, Confidence, Judgement** - Do you appear to know what you are doing and grasp complexity and issues.
- **Low risk** - Would promoting you cause problems? Do you have red flags?
- **Alignment with priorities** - Connect your work to whatever initiative they care about, you become relevant to them.

# Managers:

## Foundational Requirements:

**Core:** *Don't create problems, build solutions. Reduce friction and make their life easier.*
**Inverse:** *Having an element of interaction with them and showing improvement can actually improve your case to them, being too smooth could make you invisibile.*

- **Handle problems without escalation** - at least bundle problems with solutions.
	- Manager dependant: some will want constant updates, others won't.
- **No surprises** - Communicate early and clearly, bad news early can be solved whilst if it's late it makes them look bad.
	- Clean and direct communication almost always a big plus.
- **Advocate for them to their leadership** - You develop them and give them credit, visibility, do a good job, etc. They'll be more likely to develop you.
	- You scratch my back I'll scratch yours, humans find it hard to not reciprocate without feeling bad anyways.
- **Low emotional maintenance**
	- Avoid unnecessary drama, conflict, complaints, constant reassurance.
	- Be someone who they don't have to worry about.
- **Predictability** - they know what they are going to get and don't have to worry that you won't execute or things will fall through.

## Personal Element:

**Core:** Figure out who your manager is - the good and the bad, and tailor your approach to your needs.
**Inverse:** Don't misread your managers type early, at least treat them with a neutral baseline level, then adapt only once you've got something concrete.

|Manager Type|What They Respond To|
|---|---|
|Detail-oriented|Thoroughness, documentation, precision|
|Big-picture focused|Strategic framing, not getting lost in weeds|
|Relationship-driven|Loyalty, personal connection, being liked|
|Results-obsessed|Output, speed, hitting numbers|
|Recognition-hungry|Credit flowing through them, public deference|
|Insecure|Reassurance, not being outshone publicly|
|Hands-off|Independence, not needing guidance|
|Controlling|Frequent updates, asking permission|
Pay attention to their actions and reactions. How they spend time, what they talk about - how they talk about things, priorities, interests, etc.
