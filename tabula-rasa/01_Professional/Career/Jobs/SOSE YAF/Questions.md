# Questions:

- **Can you tell us about why you were particularly drawn to this opportunity, and what made you apply?**
	- I felt like I could help out in my community and make things better for young people my age or the next generation of young people. I'm in a position now where I want act, make a difference and bring about positive change.
- **Can you tell us a bit more about what you like about Dumfries and Galloway? And what you think could be improved?**
	- I enjoy the nature of the place. It's a very cosy place to be if you value nature and the environment, which I think with the issues of climate change on the horizon, more people are waking up and realising the importance of nature.
	- What I think could be improved, though, is opportunity — especially for young people looking for career growth and long-term stability. This isn’t just a local issue, it’s something I’m researching for the Open University too. There’s a real challenge across the UK with economic hardship leading to frustration and a sense of stagnation.
	- What's the progress on things such as the Borderlands deal or the south of Scotland regional economic partnership?
- **In what ways do you think the young people of the Youth Advisory Forum could have a positive impact on the South of Scotland?**
	- By gathering data on the experiences and perspectives of what it's like being a young person in the south of Scotland. I think the main factor would be that you're bridging policy with real-world experiences.
- **Do you have any specific skills you’d like to develop or gain through being part of the Youth Advisory Forum and SOSE more generally?**
	- I'd like to enhance my interpersonal skills: such as leadership, public speaking, and initiative. I want to improve my ability to seize the opportunities in life, not only for myself but for my community and friends as well.
- **It was interesting to read about your passion for Chess and your involvement in Dumfries Chess Club. How did you find out about the club and what more do you think can be done to better promote and publicise such groups?**
	- I found out about the club through searching online via chess.com, since they had a club on there because they moved to online during covid, a member invited me in and said I should turn up to the club.
	- It's mostly about these groups or clubs to advertise themselves. For instance: the Dumfries chess club does want new members. But if a brand new player showed up each day and got wrecked over and over, they'd likely not stay.
		- Leveraging social media or the internet would be strong for any org looking to appeal to young people.
- **What in particular do you enjoy most about running around Eskrigg nature reserve and do you think we make enough of our green spaces and nature to promote the region?**
	- It find it to be very relaxing and enjoyable after a days work - It's nice going around the path or routes I go and saying hi to various dog walkers.
	- I don't know about promotion, the green spaces I've found have been from word of mouth. There would be young people or each side of the coin - some would go: "There's nothing to do here, why bother" and others would go: "Finally some peace and quiet."
		- I think the younger generation is more aware of mental health and the power the nature can have on that.
- **Are there any other areas in your application that you’d like to take this opportunity to expand on?**
	- I think it would be a good idea to allow people to be able to contact SOSE YAF members through some kind of channel so that they can gather data from them or discuss issues or problems that they are having. Even just having a few email links could really help.
	- Something small but I'd think it would be really useful.
	- You made a framework with innovate UK, how has that changed your current operations?
- **Availability – can you tell us more about your current commitments, and when you would prefer to take part in the Forum? Day/evening/weekdays/weekends?**
	- I'm very flexible - Only times which are a hard no would be Monday's 7-9pm, since that's my chess club evening.
	- I'm studying at the open university and working on my business on the side, so whilst I may have meetings or appointments, I can flex them around your preferred times.
