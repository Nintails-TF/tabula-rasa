## Definition and Fundamentals:

### What is SIEM? (Security Information and Event Management)

The purpose of SIEMs is that they collect information across an environment. In essence they and the first line of human intervention in the system, if preventative controls such as firewalls, patches, access controls do not work.

SIEMs are the eyes and ears of your security architecture, not the shield. They enable people to monitor a system in real-time and respond to threats and alerts within the system.

### What Do SIEMS Do?

The flow of a SIEM is as followed:
1. **Data ingestion or Collection** 
	1. SIEM solutions grab data from various sources.
2. **Data normalization and aggregation**
	1. Gathered data must be processed and normalized so that the SIEM can understand it.
3. **Data Analysis**
	1. SIEM displays data via dashboards, visualizations, alerts, and incidents so that a SOC team can identify potential risks and respond to them.

SIEM tools have great range of core functionality, including but not limited to:
- Collection and administration of log events.
- Examining log events and other supplemental data across the system.
- Incident handling.
- Visual summaries.
- Documentation.

SIEMs are used by IT personnel to detect cyberattacks that are in motion or respond to potential threats or errors that may pose problems in the future. It enables people to respond and resolve threats quicker.

SIEMs are the cornerstone of an organisations security tactics, giving people a complete working method for identifying, managing, and reporting on threats.

## The Evolution and History of SIEM:

SIEMs first came onto scene due to a partnership between two Garner analysts which combined Security Information Management (SIM) and Security Event Management (SEM). They [published this idea in 2005](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1201/1086.1065898X/45390.14.3.20050701/89149.6) initially, since them SIEMs have evolved.

I've written a [[../Extension Notes/History of SIEMs|History of SIEMs]] that denotes the present and future of SIEMs, but to summarise:

**SIEM Evolution:**
- **1st Gen (2000s-2010s)**: On-premises, rule-based detection, compliance-focused log collection.
- **2nd Gen (2010s-present)**: Cloud-enabled, behavioural analytics, threat intelligence integration, SOAR automation, contextualized alerts.
- **3rd Gen (2025+)**: AI-driven with generative models, autonomous threat response, risk-based alerting, natural language interaction.
- **Core Evolution**: Passive log aggregation → Intelligent correlation → AI-assisted autonomous defence.
- **Major Barrier**: Regulated industries require explainable decisions; "black box" AI lacks auditability and trust.

## How Do SIEMs Work?:

## Basic Overview:

SIEMs systems work by gather data from many sources, such as: PCs, network devices, servers, and more. The data is then standardized and consolidated for easy analysis.

SIEMs generate huge amounts of alerts. An hourly log of a poorly-tuned SIEM can generate 100-1000 alerts. So fine-tuning of the SIEM to detect and alert high-risk events is critical.

SIEMs work in conjunction with IPS and IDS by processing the logs and other data generated by them to integrate data from various sources to map out, solve, and posture for threat detection and security issues.
## Technical Overview:

SIEMs differ from regular log-aggregation tools as they conduct various techniques to meet the demands of a security team or business.
### Parsing:

Parsing in a SIEM involves converting raw, unstructured logs into structured fields that can be searched, correlated, and analyzed. This ensures logs from different sources share a consistent format through **normalization**, allowing the SIEM to effectively centralize and interpret data. 

The process typically includes **pattern matching** (using regex to identify log structures), **field extraction** (labelling values like user, IP, or event ID), and **type conversion** (transforming strings into usable data types such as integers or timestamps).

While tools like Splunk and Elastic Stack handle parsing differently, the core principles remain the same. SOC teams must manage challenges such as multi-line logs, inconsistent vendor formats, custom application outputs, and performance constraints—ensuring parsing remains accurate, efficient, and compliant with company or regulatory standards.

[[../Extension Notes/Parsing Process|The parsing process in detail.]]
### Enrichment:

Enrichment adds context to raw logs—turning “what happened” into “why it matters.” By combining data from threat intelligence, geolocation, and identity sources, it improves detection accuracy, accelerates investigations, and helps prioritize real threats.

However, enrichment must balance speed and accuracy; too many lookups or outdated feeds can cause delays and false positives. SOC teams should design efficient, regularly updated pipelines tailored to their environment to ensure enriched data drives faster, smarter security decisions.

[[../Extension Notes/Enrichment|The enrichment process in detail]]
### Indexing:

Indexing organizes parsed and enriched data so SIEMs can search massive datasets quickly using **inverted indexes** that map key values (like IPs or users) to specific events. By partitioning data by time, SIEMs scan only relevant logs, greatly improving search speed and efficiency.

Different SIEMs use unique methods—**Splunk** with TSIDX files and **Elastic** with Lucene-based indexes—but the goal is the same: enable fast, scalable, and cost-efficient querying. Effective indexing turns raw log storage into actionable intelligence within seconds.

[[../Extension Notes/Indexing|The indexing process in detail]]

### Retention Policies:

Retention policies tier log data by age to balance cost, performance, and compliance: **Hot** for real-time access, **Warm** for ongoing investigations, **Cold** for historical analysis, and **Frozen** for legal/archive needs. Tiering reduces storage costs compared to keeping all data on high-performance storage.

Policies must meet regulatory requirements (PCI DSS, HIPAA, GDPR, SOX, GLBA), consider log criticality and type, and ensure archived data can be restored. SIEMs like Splunk, Elastic, QRadar, and Sentinel provide lifecycle or archive settings to enforce these policies efficiently..

[[../Extension Notes/Retention Polices|Retention polices in detail]]

### Query Languages:

Query languages let analysts search, filter, and analyse SIEM data, with different SIEMs using different syntaxes. **Splunk SPL** uses a Unix-pipe style, ideal for stats and dashboards but proprietary and slower on large datasets. **KQL** (Elastic/Microsoft) is SQL-like, optimized for time-series queries, while **Lucene** supports quick ad-hoc searches in Elastic.

For efficiency, always use **indexed fields, time bounds, and early filters**. Avoid leading wildcards, full-index scans, heavy regex, or unnecessary field extraction to keep queries fast and scalable.

## SIEM Business Requirements & Use Cases:

### Log Aggregation and Normalisation:

This is the most critical role of a SIEM - placing all the information from firewalls, applications, databases, etc. all into a single place for review.

It massively speeds up SOC teams so that they can react quicker and solve security incidents quicker.
### Threat Alerting:

Having a SIEM notify IT security teams about possible threats enables teams to carry out after action, more targeted investigations and respond to potential security issues efficiently.

By having the alarm bells sound quickly to the corresponding team, threats can be dealt with or minimized and business critical or key details can be secured.
### Contextualization & Response:

If a SIEM was to send an alert for every possible security event, a team will be flooded with alerts, it is key to contextualise alerts and determine who is involved what areas of the network are effected and what did it happen.

Automatic configurations can filter some threats that are contextualized. Since we want to reduce alert fatigue and concentrate on the most credible threats.
### Compliance:

SIEM solutions are mandatory due to government rules in certain organisations and industries. Regulations such as: PCI DSS, HIPAA, GDPR require that organisations have sufficient security.

SIEMs help gather data which is necessary for audits and regulators.

## Why Do We Need SIEMs?

1. IT teams need a place where they can easily access all logs and data, especially for bigger organisations
2. IT teams can act more quickly in the even of security issues to protect or minimize the impact of security issues.
3. Banking, Finance, Insurance, Healthcare, and other critical industries require a managed SIEM on-premise or in the cloud to adhere to security and compliance standards such as ISO and HIPAA.
