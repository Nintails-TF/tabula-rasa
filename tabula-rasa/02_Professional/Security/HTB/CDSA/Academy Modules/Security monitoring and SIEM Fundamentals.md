# SIEM Fundamentals:

## Definition and Fundamentals:

### What is SIEM? (Security Information and Event Management)

The purpose of SIEMs is that they collect information across an environment. In essence they and the first line of human intervention in the system, if preventative controls such as firewalls, patches, access controls do not work.

SIEMs are the eyes and ears of your security architecture, not the shield. They enable people to monitor a system in real-time and respond to threats and alerts within the system.

### What Do SIEMS Do?

SIEM tools have great range of core functionality, including but not limited to:

- Collection and administration of log events.
- Examining log events and other supplemental data across the system.
- Incident handling.
- Visual summaries.
- Documentation.

SIEMs are used by IT personnel to detect cyberattacks that are in motion or respond to potential threats or errors that may pose problems in the future. It enables people to respond and resolve threats quicker.

SIEMs are the cornerstone of an organisations security tactics, giving people a complete working method for identifying, managing, and reporting on threats.

## The Evolution and History of SIEM:

SIEMs first came onto scene due to a partnership between two Garner analysts which combined Security Information Management (SIM) and Security Event Management (SEM). They [published this idea in 2005](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1201/1086.1065898X/45390.14.3.20050701/89149.6) initially, since them SIEMs have evolved.

I've written a [[../Extension Notes/History of SIEMs|History of SIEMs]] that denotes the present and future of SIEMs, but to summarise:

**SIEM Evolution:**
- **1st Gen (2000s-2010s)**: On-premises, rule-based detection, compliance-focused log collection.
- **2nd Gen (2010s-present)**: Cloud-enabled, behavioural analytics, threat intelligence integration, SOAR automation, contextualized alerts.
- **3rd Gen (2025+)**: AI-driven with generative models, autonomous threat response, risk-based alerting, natural language interaction.
- **Core Evolution**: Passive log aggregation → Intelligent correlation → AI-assisted autonomous defence.
- **Major Barrier**: Regulated industries require explainable decisions; "black box" AI lacks auditability and trust.

## How Do SIEMs Work?:

SIEMs systems work by gather data from many sources, such as: PCs, network devices, servers, and more. The data is then standardized and consolidated for easy analysis.

SIEM managers/analysts look into any chunks of data and alerts to detect threats. This allows a business to get an overview of their security standing.

Alerts tell personnel that they must look into a possible security event or incident. People are informed via pop-up messages, console messages, text messages, phone calls, or emails.

SIEMs generate huge amounts of alerts. An hourly log of a SIEM can generate 100-1000 alerts. So fine-tuning of the SIEM to detect and alert high-risk events is critical.

SIEMs work in conjunction with IPS and IDS by processing the logs and other data generated by them to integrate data from various sources to map out, solve, and posture for threat detection and security issues.
## SIEM Business Requirements & Use Cases:

### Log Aggregation and Normalisation:

This is the most critical role of a SIEM - placing all the information from firewalls, applications, databases, etc. all into a single place for review.

It massively speeds up SOC teams so that they can react quicker and solve security incidents quicker.
### Threat Alerting:

Having a SIEM notify IT security teams about possible threats enables teams to carry out after action, more targeted investigations and respond to potential security issues efficiently.

By having the alarm bells sound quickly to the corresponding team, threats can be dealt with or minimized and business critical or key details can be secured.
### Contextualization & Response:

If a SIEM was to send an alert for every possible security event, a team will be flooded with alerts, it is key to contextualise alerts and determine who is involved what areas of the network are effected and what did it happen.

Automatic configurations can filter some threats that are contextualized. Since we want to reduce alert fatigue and concentrate on the most credible threats.
### Compliance:

SIEM solutions are mandatory due to government rules in certain organisations and industries. Regulations such as: PCI DSS, HIPAA, GDPR require that organisations have sufficient security.

SIEMs help gather data which is necessary for audits and regulators.
## Data Flow within a SIEM:

1. **Data ingestion or Collection** 
	1. SIEM solutions grab data from various sources.
2. **Data normalization and aggregation**
	1. Gathered data must be processed and normalized so that the SIEM can understand it.
3. **Data Analysis**
	1. SIEM displays data via dashboards, visualizations, alerts, and incidents so that a SOC team can identify potential risks and respond to them.

## Why Do We Need SIEMs?

1. IT teams need a place where they can easily access all logs and data, especially for bigger organisations
2. IT teams can act more quickly in the even of security issues to protect or minimize the impact of security issues.
3. Banking, Finance, Insurance, Healthcare, and other critical industries require a managed SIEM on-premise or in the cloud to adhere to security and compliance standards such as ISO and HIPAA.
