## Core Learning Resources

### Intro to Vmix:

**The live streaming software we will be using**

We're moving away from OBS as V-Mix gives us better replay options than OBS, but it is a paid piece of software so don't worry about trying to get hold of it—just watch a couple of videos. Principles are the same as OBS, just a different layout.

### Justin Brown at Primal Video:

**Excellent starting point for basics into everything**

Justin has many videos to watch and is a good place to start for fundamentals.

### Live Audio Mixing for Streaming:

**Church front presentation**

This is church front, so you've probably seen this already.

### Accsoon Cinemaster 4K Wireless Transmission System:

This video is by Philip Bloom. He's worth watching in general but he doesn't do much for live streaming—however, he knows his stuff when it comes to cameras.

## Equipment Setup Plan:

We are planning on using:
- **Sony FS700** as the main camera
- A couple of **Go Pros** for the goal cameras
- Some smaller **Blackmagic micro box cameras** for the wide shot and commentators camera

Here is a rough layout of what we are going to implement (I usually draw these for every venue and event we do):
