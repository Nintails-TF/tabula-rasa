# # Domain & Hosting Setup (~£25-35)

### **Domain Registration (£8-12/year)**
- `.dev` domain from Google Domains/Cloudflare (~£10/year)
- `.dev` domains come with built-in HTTPS and look professional for developers

**Option 1: Free Tier (Recommended to start)**
- **Vercel/Netlify**: Free for personal projects, excellent for React/static sites
- **GitHub Pages**: Free hosting, integrates with your repos

**Option 2: Paid Hosting (£15-25/year)**
- **Vercel Pro**: Better performance, analytics
- **DigitalOcean App Platform**: More control, good for full-stack apps
