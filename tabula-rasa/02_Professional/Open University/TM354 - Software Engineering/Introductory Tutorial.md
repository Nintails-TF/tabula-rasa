*What made you go down the OU route? What advice would you give to your younger self starting out with self-learning?:*

Life-long learner, enjoy learning. Working with technology helps you keep on the ball in the field. Every extra course or qualification opens more and more doors. Works both in practical and commercial IT in financial services and also teaching. Keep learning and striving and learn a broad range of skills and knowledge.

Plan in accordance to the course calendar. Employment in the sector has grown, so there is a vested financial interest in teaching people tech.

Variety works well and the larger skills base helps - especially complimentary skills. Chris has been a software engineer and a project manager.
## Background and Philosophy:

**TM354 Includes:**
- Structure, case study
	- Build summary notes, at the end of the module, be able to quickly skim the material.
	- Coursework is dense - key words and terms are repeated.
		- 6-10 key diagrams - feature in the final exam too.
		- Have a key term glossary and diagram list.
- TMAs are good for learning
	1. One thing to read, another thing to actually make. This is when you actually understand it.
		1. Solidify the theoretical knowledge through practice.
	2. Look at tutor feedback in TMAs. Helps your learning.
		1. TMA questions are similar to the EMA.
	3. Look at the 3 TMAs or doing the questions again can work well.
		1. You refresh your knowledge, get more practice doing, and make what you've made better.
	4. If something comes up in the TMA - LEARN IT!
- Use the course forms
	- Ask for help in the forms, read them and keep and eye on them.
	- If you ask questions, you expand your students know
- Up to 3 weeks extensions (All tutors can give this as a minimum)

Follow the course calendar and go to tutorials, the more information you soak up. Different tutors have different perspectives. Follow the weekly course blocks and content.

## Module Outline and Content

### Block 1 - Domain to Requirements:

- Software, architecture, process choice
- Different approaches to software development
	- Plan-driven (Waterfall) to agile.
	- Factors that affect the choice of a process.
- Modelling within software development
	- Agile perspective
	- UP (Unified Processing) /UML

- Requirements and Agile
	- Functional - What the user wants or needs
	- Non-functional - The useability of the system
- Representing requirements

- Understand the domain
	- Business rules and processes
	- Representing domain activity
- Capturing requirements with use cases
	- I.e. The tutor or the student accessing the TM354
- Prototyping the user interface.
	- What the UI would

- Case study part 1.
	- Chain of hotels: problem statement, use cases, user stories, Volere templates
	- Case study focus
		- 
### Block 2 - Analysis to Design:

Structural modelling
- Modelling the structure of the domain (techniques

Dynamic Modelling - from analysis to design
- Design by contract (DBC)
- Dynamic Modelling
	- Sequence Diagrams
- Interaction diagrams
- Design decisions
	- Managing associations
### Block 3 - Architecture to Product:

Each block has a book and there is a case study at the last unit of each block. Sometimes the course team highlights errata's or news in the tech world.

*Would you say that creating diagrams, is critical to success in TM354?*

***
## Assessment:

Formative quiz at the end of each unit (Except unit tests)

3 equally weighted TMAs, EMAs - so there are all open book. Plagiarism checker, you'll get flagged if you take info that isn't in your own words. 

Short question on concepts and relating to them.
Longer question on application of techniques.

Revision for the exam - Look through the exam papers and the structure and going through together and what approach and mark breakdown can be done.

You can send questions in the forms. First instance should be the module forms. Course team made the course, so they understand how it would work. 

Ask questions to tutors if you don't get a response in due time. Should be on the same day responses in the forms.

TMA01 - requirements concepts
- Agile, sharing activity diagram, a use case, choice of approach.

TMA01 - Structural modelling: 
- Designing a class diagram, completing a model, sequence diagram, state chart diagram.

TMA03 - architecture, patterns and reuse
- shareholders, design patterns, architectural styles, scenarios, testing, code complexity.

Exam assesses everything.

- Read the question - Only Include what is asked for.
- Stay within the world limit.
	- (+ or - 10%. e.g. 100 word limit 90-110 words)
- Use a succinct writing style that is accurate.
- Avoid scrappy writing and poor English.
	- Completing diagrams, making a clear diagram, explaining things clearly.

## Sharespace Practice:

Make a diagram, get feedback, make improvements.

Share spaces simulate stand-up meetings. When you log into sharespace, you can't access any work until you upload your own work.

## Questions:

*Would you prefer a shorter, leaner answer to a question in a TMA or Exam. Or a more detailed and thorough explanation of a concept?:*

Follow the word limit, use things such as formatting, italics - bold and clear formatting and grammar.

Certain topics can be explained in a few worlds - list meaning list - don't describe in detail. Briefly describe, describe in detail - look at the operative words.
