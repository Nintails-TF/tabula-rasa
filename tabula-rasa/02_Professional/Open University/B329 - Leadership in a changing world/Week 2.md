# Turbulent Contexts: the Socio-political Environment of Precarity:

## Introduction:

Precarious workers (Amazon warehouse, Doordash, zero-hour contracts) exist precisely because they ARE replaceable.

**Why Precarity Persists:**
- **Low-skill + High-turnover = Transactional management** (algorithms, not humans).
- Organizations rationally choose extraction over investment.
- 14 million in UK poverty → desperate labour pool maintains replaceability.
- System design replaces human leadership to scale and cut costs.

**The Result:**
- Workers are algorithmically managed, disposable
- Food banks at all-time high; people earn poverty wages
- Extract-and-exit executives optimize for short-term extraction
- UN: austerity has "inflicted great misery"

Traditional leadership theory (communication, collaboration, personal development) assumes stable relationships. What leadership is possible when the system is designed to prevent those relationships from forming?

The challenge is to develop leadership that helps people break free from precarious conditions or at least provides ownership and dignity at work. 

*"Equal application of the rules must appear fair - but fundamentally, we are unequal."*

## Key Questions:

- What are the forces that have driven an increase in precarity, in the UK and around the world?
- Who are the people primarily affected by precarity?
- How can we better understand precarity through experience?

# 1. Defining Precarity and Its Implications for Leadership:

We define precarious as:

> To be vulnerable to the kill or decision of others, dependant on chance or circumstance; uncertain; liable to fail; exposed to risk, hazardous, insecure, unstable, subject to or fraught with danger or insecurity.

Precarity creates two circumstances:

1. The idea that our own wellbeing is outside our direct control and in the hands of other entities, such as businesses or governments, or accidents or illnesses. 
2. The experience of danger and risk.

Precarity is an issue that effects people inside and outside of work, but primarily in this module, what causes people into work. We define precarious works as:

> Employment involving contractual insecurity; weakened employment security for permanent workers, and non standard contracts and forms for temporary work, fixed-term, zero-hour and undeclared work.

Often not knowing what you are going to be doing in the next few months, weeks, or even days negatively effects people. Being a strong leader when living precariously is tough, many people are living in a way where they are making ends meet.

The idea is that we need to learn how to support people going through this, if we are being managed liked so, we can assert more of a collective leadership. Additionally, we can figure out how leadership can ameliorate precarity and find ways of leading from positions of precarity.

# 2. Causes of Precarity:

Precarious living and work aren't a part of natural affairs but are a result of policy, outwardly the end goal of said policy hasn't been to create a class of people who would struggle on a daily basis, this is what has happened though.

**We have the seven drivers of precarity:**
## 1. Global Recessions:

The 2007-2008 banking crisis cause mass unemployment and bailout loans from the government. The subsequence austerity has resulting into more cuts into public spending, low wages, homelessness, and overworked and under-funded public services are the norm.
## 2. Government Policy:

Neoliberalism - which has lead to free markets, reduced state services, and privatization, enhanced austerity measures. Slashing public spending whilst giving wealthy and corporations reduced tax hasn't helped stimulate economic recovery.
## 3. Weakening of Trade Unions:

Workers are less likely to join and be a part of unions, reducing their collective power to demand for better pay and conditions. This is because of changing demographics and collective bargaining.
## 4. Poor Housing:

Research shows that young people are half as likely to own homes as their parents (Wetzstein, 2017, p.3162). Fewer council houses are being built, more people rent privately in less secure, less regulated, and low quality housing (Wetzstein, 2017, p.3162). This creates stress and health problems (Wetzstein, 2017, p.3162).

A large issue is that housing is being viewed as an investment rather than a home, capital is being used to buy up homes as a mechanism of investment, which drives up prices for people who want a place to live (Wetzstein, 2017, p.3164).

Young people often have to **choose** between owning a home or having children, as both are a serious expense (Wetzstein, 2017, p.3160). Those who are in low-income or those who work in essential urban services - teachers, nurses, trades, etc. get priced out of tight urban housing markets (Wetzstein, 2017, p.3162).

## 5. Automation of Work

Automation of work on paper presents liberation, but threatens stable employment, with workers being managed by algorithms rather than humans. This increases precarity and doesn't improve the conditions of workers.
## 6. War and Refugees:

Armed conflicts have displaced 65 million people since 2016, Refugees have extreme precarity, vulnerability, and daily uncertainty. 
## 7. Climate Change:

Though not fully impacting the UK yet, climate change could make land inhospitable by 2050. Climate change represents a growing threat to stability and security globally.
