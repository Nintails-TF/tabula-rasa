# Block 1: Leadership in Turbulent Times:


The key skill in the first block is critically thinking about turbulence, precarity, populism, and multi-culturalism.

- **Week 1:** Turbulence and technological changes, the role of social media in building and mediating leadership.
- **Week 2:** Precarity how it effects others, how to lead in organisations with precarity. 
- **Week 3:** The rise of populism, what populism is and what is the relationship between a populist leader and a charismatic leader is.
- **Week 4:** Multi-culturalism and it's implication on leadership, how different cultures prefer leadership.

## Introduction:

We define leadership as: 

> *A collection of concepts concerned with how meaningful direction is generated, offered, accepted and resisted within and across groups and organisations.*

There are three key words to remember about leadership:
1. **Meaningful**
	1. *Sense making - you need to build an emotional commitment with others.*
2. **Direction**
	1. *Sense giving - you need to give people a direction of where to go and what to do.*
3. **Followership**
	1. *Other people in an organisation that are inspired or influence to follow values or someone.*

### Key Questions:

- What do we mean by leadership and turbulence, and which theory can help to understand and explain leadership in turbulent times?
- Why is it important to think critically about some of the phenomena occurring in our changing world?
- Why are social networks important for contemporary leadership?

*Answer in due time.*

# 1. What is Turbulence:

We define turbulence as:

> **Situations where events, demands, and support change at a highly variable, inconsistent, unexpected and unpredictable ways.**

Turbulence is usually used to describe weather or currents, within the area of organisations and leadership, we can denote two different forms:

1. **External turbulence**
	- *Factors outside your organisation or group. So certain fields of study or work, geographic locations have more/less external turbulence and uncertainty.*
	- *Including but not limited to: legal rulings, accidents, technology advancements, wars, protests, or partisan conflict*
2. **Internal turbulence**
	- *Factors within your organisation or group.*
	- *Including: factional conflict, staff turnover, conflicting rules, internal reform, or complex structures. **(Ansell and Trondal, 2018)***

In modernity, it could be argued that turbulence is not limited to a single crisis or event. But is consistently enduring and existing within business, politics, and society. You have 4 main factors that support this claim:

1. **International real-world events**
	- Globalisation, technological changes, political moves such as Russo-Ukraine war, The Isreal-Palastine situation, and Brexit.
2. **The changing character of politics**
	- News and information has become more polarised and versatile. Social media streams accelerate both trust gain and loss.
3. **The nature of public problems**
	- Climate change, economic inequalities.
4. **Organisational and institutional complexity**
	- Supply chains are longer and stakeholder networks are more complex.

The question is: ***How does this change leadership?***
