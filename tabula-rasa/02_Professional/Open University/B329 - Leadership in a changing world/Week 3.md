# Turbulent Contexts: Leadership and Populism:

This week examines populist movements emerging globally and their distinctive approaches to leadership. Economic and social turbulence over the last decade has fuelled the rise of populism across different regions, fundamentally changing how we understand and practice politics.

The focus is on how populist leaders operate within turbulent environments, and the relationship between populism and leadership styles - particularly the connection between populist and charismatic leadership. We'll explore how these movements both shape and are shaped by social change.

## Key Questions:

- What is populism?
- Why are examples of populism arising in contemporary society?
- What forms of leadership are seen in populist movements, and what are the characteristics of populist leadership?

***

# 1 What is Populism?:

*What is populism, how are populist movements lead, and what is the impact of populism in our world?*

**Populism:** *Describes a political approach or ideology that frames problems as a struggle between the people/average (portraited as virtuous) against against the elite/establishment (Depicted as being corrupt and self-serving).*

In essence, people want to believe in a leader or person who will change things for the better for them or their families/communities. The danger is that populism can be used to promote harmful ideologies - racism, sexism, xenophobia, etc.

Populist movements are a doubled edged sword, they can draw out the potential of the people by reconnecting them with the nations or organisations priorities, but they can also be divisive and exclude people. Such as extreme-right wing populism.

Populist movements are often characterised by a single charismatic leader. Such leaders are frequently individualistic and are colourful.

Though not each group associated with populism is the same, some may promote or damage democracy or promote negative values, or do they challenge stale political systems.

## 1.1 Defining Populism:

The definition of what populism is can change depending on who is using it, making it a tricky and slippy term to define, it is wise in this case, to ensure we have an understanding of different interpretations.

Most definitions contain the following:
1. The importance of the people in populist ideology in movements
	1. (It's literally in the name "pop"-ulism)
2. The opposing group that the people are fighting against.
	1. The bourgeoisie, the elite, the billionaires, the Nazis, etc.

The issue is: **Who are the people?** **Does this mean everyone or just the majority?** 

For our module; populism is defined as:

> Populism is an ideology or political movement that separates society into the virtuous ‘people’ and the corrupt ‘elite’, and which sees ‘the elite’ as depriving ‘the people’ of their rights, prosperity, identity and voice. It sets ‘the people’ against ‘the elite’ and opposes elements of society that oppose the will of ‘the people’.

A person may be in an "elite" situation, but may relate to the people more. (e.g. PHD, high wealth, academic job - Intellectual elite). But may have other factors that relate to the people (e.g. mental health struggles, unemployment history, tough family environment, etc.)

*It almost highlights how anyone can be made either a friend or an enemy using the methodology of populism.*

Summary:
- Populism is apolitical.
- Populist rhetoric opposes corruption.
	- In real world practice, this isn't always true.
- Populist movements aren't always democratic.
- Populist movements don't always want power, other times they want changes to happen.
- Populism assumes that everyone is following the same voice or idea.

## 1.3 Populism in the Media:

Most populist groups don't exactly label themselves as populist; it's media, journalists, academics who apply this broad label to many different groups - this can dilute the public perception on what populism is.
## Contemporary Populist Movements/Leaders:

|Name of Movement or Leader|Geographical Location|Right or Left Wing|Leadership Characteristics|
|---|---|---|---|
|Juan and Eva Perón|Argentina|Right|Glamorous, leading mass rallies, charismatic|
|Donald Trump / MAGA Movement|USA|Right|Anti-establishment businessman, direct communication via social media, rallies, "drain the swamp" rhetoric|
|Marine Le Pen / National Rally|France|Right|Anti-immigration, anti-EU, claims to represent "forgotten France"|
|Jair Bolsonaro|Brazil|Right|Military background, anti-corruption rhetoric, social media presence, confrontational|

|Geert Wilders / PVV|Netherlands|Right|Anti-Islam, anti-EU, freedom rhetoric, provocative style|
|Recep Tayyip Erdoğan / AKP|Turkey|Right|Authoritarian style, claims to represent traditional/conservative Turks against secular elite|
## Key Observations:

- Left wing populism focusses on economic elites, corporations, and billionaires as the enemy.
	- Economic elites - Wall street, banks, multinational corporations
	- Political establishment - Career politicians that serve corporate interests rather than the people
	- Neo-liberal institutions - IMF, world bank, free trade, etc.
- Right wing populism focusses on cultural elites, immigrants, and international institutions as the enemy
	- Cultural elites - Academics, journalists, metropolitan liberals
	- Immigrants and minorities - threats to national identity
	- International institutions - EU, UN, NATO, etc.
	- Globalists - cosmopolitan elites disconnected from what is actually happening in a country.

# 2. Populism in Contemporary Society:

Turbulence is often the wind that shifts new political movements and balances of power. Uncertainty can act as a stimulus to get people to make their opinions known and ensure that their interests aren't pushed aside.

Thus, populist movements have grown over time - especially the EU and US. The long term impact of: 2008 market crash, movement of unsettled population, wealth inequality, and policy changes have been motivators for people to conclude that changes should be made.

The failure of mainstream policy can also exasperate these issues, leading to underdogs or individuals to rise up against the establishment and challenge them, by concluding that power is constrained by the elite.
## Occupy Wall Street:

An example of **resistance leadership**.

**Key Rhetoric:**
- 99% versus the 1%. Ordinary versus wealthy - very populist
	- Wall street bankers, corporations, and the rich, benefiting from bailouts whilst the poor suffer.
- Anti-establishment - very populist
	- Criticised the collusion of the Government and financial institutions. 
	- Challenged both political parties in the US.
- Economic grievances in turbulent times - populism grows in uncertainty. 
	- Massive unemployment, foreclosures, and debt.
	- Anger about inequality and injustice.

**Differences:**
- Leaderless structure.
	- Occupy Wall Street didn't use a hierarchical leader, but a group consensus and leadership rotations.
- Vague Demands
	- Traditional populism has a clear goal - but occupy wall street didn't have clear policy goal.

## Trump's Election Campaigns:

**Key Rhetoric:**
- Drain the swamp
	- Attacking the elites in Washington, get rid of the snakes and backstabbers.
- Charismatic leadership
	- Trump as a larger than life figure. Personality and performance over policy.
- Social media as a tool
	- Using twitter to build a persona and sidestep mainstream news.
		- Got more popular as people saw him as anti-establishment
	- Relates to the growing power of social media in influence and leadership.
- Giving simple promises and ideas in Turbulent times.
	- Economically insecure, vulnerable people losing national identity.
		- Make America great again, build a wall and make Mexico pay for it, build jobs.

## 2.3. Understanding the Rise of Populism:


1. What clues can you find to suggest why populism is increasing in support in society?
	1. It is suggested that precarity and turbulence, increases populism. In the UK there is a growing distrust, apathy, and hatred for the establishment. Because it feels as if there is a failure in the Government, that they do not help improve peoples lives.
	2. If people were employed, had strong communities with friends and family, and had meaningful time for leisure, would they even care about policy?
	3. Those who are economically secure do care about policy, perhaps they are even more active in the political sphere. But the care for a different reason, rather than precarity (values, morals, culture, etc.)
2. Looking at turbulence, how do social and economic factors create a turbulent environment for political leadership.
	1. When jobs are insecure and replacable, people don't have ground to stand on, they may just be trying to keep their head above water. Socially when communities are changing rapidly, it can be difficult to ascribe an identity to said group.
	2. Populism provides a simple message or idea for everyone to get behind - e.g. Build more houses, make more jobs, etc.
		1. In reality, these steps aren't so easy.
	3. People can end up feeling isolated and lonely, perhaps like they don't matter - populist ideologies, can feel empowering as people band together to defeat an "evil".
3. What characteristics of populist leadership emerge from this account? Why do you think that these leadership characteristics emerge in turbulent contexts?]
	1. Charismatic leadership styles build hope and trust in a person to change the system.
		1. Emotional prose rather that boring dry policy.
	2. Framing and using the elite as a scapegoat to say "this is why you are having problems - it's the billionaires/immigrants/etc."
	3. Using rallies/social media to bypass mainstream media.
		1. Makes themselves seem more cool/counter-culture, not dependant on the institution they are fighting.
	4. Provide simple solutions that people can digest quickly, rather than complex 5-year plans that nobody will read.
4. Reflect on the examples you have encountered so far in this session. Is it reasonable to use the adjective ‘populist’ to describe them all?
	1. The term populist does have varying definitions depending on who you are talking to, it can describe a broad range of movements, as a label is works fine enough, but doesn't paint a full picture of a movement. (Occupy wall-street VS Trump Elections)
	2. Populism is also used as a pejorative at times, to mar the reputation of a movement by media and journalism.
		1. Most people don't have a clue what it even means, perhaps by design.

# 3. Charismatic Leadership:

Populist movements are often associated with a single leader who appears uniquely gifted at promoting the interests of the group.

A *charismatic leader* is one who is larger than life figures who seem to understand the concerns of ordinary people, they grow and then sustain public support.
