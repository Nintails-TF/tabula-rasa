# Insights:

Traditional leadership is not useless - nor is the western perspective. It is similar to how we have petrol and electric cars. Because of climate change, the world will eventually move to an electric car model - yet petrol pumps and diesel cars still roam the road - traditional institutions and models still are cemented in society.

The world will change and leadership will change also, but your leadership style should be influenced by what is around you - if the people, environments, and organisations appreciate an older model, then you take that path. If they are more modern, then you adapt your approach to be more progressive.

Ultimately, being static in your ideals that you as a leader should act in a certain way. That is not true to the demands of different cultures, people, domains, and turbulence. Leaders who can remain flexible and listen to the wind and how it shifts will prove to have the greatest impact in the modern era.
