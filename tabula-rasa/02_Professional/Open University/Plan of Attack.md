## Strategy: TMA-Driven Learning

**Don't catch up linearly. Learn what you need for TMAs, backfill gaps later.**
### Content Priorities:
1. **Priority 1:** TMA-critical content only
2. **Priority 2:** Foundation concepts
3. **Priority 3:** Supplementary material - **skip for now**
### Speed Learning:
- Read learning outcomes first
- Skim headings/structure
- Focus on examples/case studies
- Skip historical background & optional readings
- Target: 1-2h per week of content (vs 6-8h normal)
