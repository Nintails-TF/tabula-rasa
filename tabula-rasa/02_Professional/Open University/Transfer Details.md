# Transfer Details:

## Credit Transfer:

Since I've got a HND and some smaller stand-alone qualifications. I can transfer if I meet the following criteria:

| SCQF Level  | OU Level     | Credit Transfer Eligibility                                                                 |
| ----------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
