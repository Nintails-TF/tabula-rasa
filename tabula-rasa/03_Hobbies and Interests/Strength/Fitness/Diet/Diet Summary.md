    - Aim for 1-2 cups daily
- **Colourful Vegetables** (bell peppers, tomatoes, carrots, beetroot)
    - Provide diverse phytonutrients (lycopene, betalains, capsanthin)
    - Each colour offers different anti-inflammatory compounds
    - Aim for "eating the rainbow" daily

## Healthy Fats
- **Extra Virgin Olive Oil**
    - Contains oleocanthal (works similarly to ibuprofen)
    - Reduces CRP and IL-6 inflammatory markers
    - Use as primary cooking oil and for dressings (2-3 tbsp daily)
- **Avocados**
    - Rich in monounsaturated fats and carotenoids
    - Reduce NF-κB inflammatory signalling
    - Support hormone production for muscle building

## Micronutrient Boosters
- **Dark Chocolate** (85%+ cocoa)
    - Excellent source of copper (balances zinc intake from supplements)
    - Rich in flavanols that reduce oxidative stress
    - Contains magnesium for muscle function and recovery
    - Effective dose: 1-2 squares (20-30g) daily
    - Choose varieties without excess added sugar
- **Fermented Foods** - All support gut health, which significantly impacts systemic inflammation
	- **Kefir**: Higher probiotic diversity than yogurt
	- **Kimchi**: Provides probiotics with unique anti-inflammatory compounds
	- **Sauerkraut**: Rich in fibre, probiotics, and vitamin K2
- **Bone Broth**

### Core Performance Supplements:

*I'm going to add a caveat here and say that if you aren't doing resistance training or physical exercise, you don't really need anything else other than the Omega-3 and Vitamin D.*

- **Creatine Monohydrate (5g daily)**
    - Increases phosphocreatine stores in muscles, supporting ATP production during high-intensity exercise
    - Enhances strength, power output, and muscle growth
    - Improves recovery between sets and reduces fatigue
    - Most researched and effective sports supplement available
    - Take daily (timing is not critical; consistency matters more)

    - Complements dietary fatty fish intake
    - Reduces exercise-induced inflammation and muscle soreness
    - Supports joint health for training longevity
    - Enhances muscle protein synthesis when combined with resistance training
    - May improve insulin sensitivity and nutrient partitioning
- **Vitamin D (4000 IU daily)**
    - Critical for bone health, particularly important for Iceland expedition
    - Supports immune function during intense training periods
    - Optimizes testosterone production, enhancing muscle growth
    - Reduces inflammatory markers, supporting recovery
    - Often deficient in northern climates and indoor-based lifestyles
- **ZMA (4.3mg Vitamin B6, 186mg Magnesium, 12mg Zinc)**
    - Supports testosterone production and hormone balance
    - Zinc is critical for protein synthesis and immune function
    - Magnesium improves sleep quality and muscle relaxation
    - Vitamin B6 enhances zinc and magnesium utilization
    - Most beneficial when taken 30-60 minutes before sleep on an empty stomach
    - Particularly effective for those with intense training schedules
## Beverages

- **Green Tea**
    - Contains EGCG and other catechins that inhibit cytokine production
    - Supports metabolism and fat oxidation
    - The hot drink of choice.
- **Tart Cherry Juice**
    - Specifically helps with exercise recovery
    - Reduces muscle soreness after workouts
    - The fruity, sugary drink of choice.
- **Water**
    - Crucial for recovery, performance, and reducing inflammation
    - Aim for at least 3-4 litres daily, more during intense training
    - The standard drink of choice.

## Specialized Additions for Your Goals

### For Iceland Expedition Training
- Increase carbohydrate portions in the 1-2 weeks before departure
- Focus on electrolyte balance with added sea salt and potassium-rich foods
- Consider adding extra calories (300-500) on high-training days
### For Body Composition Goals
- During cutting: maintain minimum 140g protein while focusing on nutrient-dense, low-calorie options
- For muscle building: gradually increase calories with emphasis on quality protein sources
- Periodize nutrition based on training intensity (higher carbs on harder training days)
