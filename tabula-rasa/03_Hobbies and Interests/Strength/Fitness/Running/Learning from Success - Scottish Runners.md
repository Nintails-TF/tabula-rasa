# Summary:

Successful athletes blend what has worked throughout history, with modern technology and data to enhance training. But everyone has followed similar training patterns and principles.

Quality and quantity exist on a spectrum. In which the individual will shift around within depending on the stage of training and the phase of career. Beginners need to focus on volume, whilst elite need to focus on quality whilst maintaining decent volume, generally.

Athletes of all kinds require a foundation or base of skills to be strong, before working on anything more complex.

## Runners:

### Andy Butchart
- Multiple Olympian that specialises in the 5k. 
- He does tons of aerobic volume (80-100 miles) during base phases.
- Uses altitude camps for training at higher altitudes throughout the year.
- Regular hill sessions for strength and power.
- Consistency in training and avoiding injury with smart progression.

Patience in how constant, injury-free, and consistent training yields great results.

### Eilish McColgan
- Lower weekly milage (70-80 miles).
- High quality sessions with lots of track work.
- Focus on strength training and core stability
- Careful nutrition planning, designed for her own needs.
- Transitioning to long distance as she ages.

Quality is better than quantity. Speed in short distances helps in the long run.

### Callum Hawkins
- Extreme volume (130-140 miles).
- Runs hard intervals during marathon workouts.
- Trains around Glasgow hilly routes to build strength.
- A focus on road and trail running.
- Uses visualisation techniques for mental gains.

Training for specifically the sport or field you care about.
