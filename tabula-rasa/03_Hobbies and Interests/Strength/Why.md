# Reasoning:

The main question is, why am I choosing to pursue strength so much? If I don't have an accurate vision or reason behind why I'm acting this way, I'll not stick to it.

One aspect I thought of is that I think I've burned myself out of the regular pleasurable substances in that I don't really enjoy them anymore.

I've also felt the consequences of weakness and that said weakness had made me feel negative about my own self-opinion and has hurt my self-esteem and confidence. I suppose there is an element of the fact that I feel inferior to others, if I was going to be 100% honest with myself. I want to prove other people wrong, to show them that I can be great, no matter what they think about me or what opinion they hold.

I mean, it's really that I don't want to let myself down really, that I want to show to myself that I can make something of myself. But what would be that endpoint that I'm aiming for?

**Summary:**
- *Through strength, I'm choosing to invest in myself rather than settle for weakness and regret.*
- *I'm building strength to prove to myself that I'm not weak.*

## The Goals of Strength:

- To look lean and strong, this helps me signal to others that they should treat me with respect.
- To not get out of puff quickly and to maintain energy even when the going gets tough.
- To have more endurance and vitality in general life.
- To life a longer and more fulfilling life.
- To be comfortable knowing that I'm making good life decisions that I can agree with.
