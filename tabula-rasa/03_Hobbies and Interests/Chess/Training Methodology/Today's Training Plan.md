# Today's Training Plan

**Morning Session (90 minutes):**
- [x] **Endgame positions: 30 minutes** (your current 50 positions)
- [x] **Tactical puzzles: 45 minutes** (30-40 puzzles focusing on basic patterns)
- [x] **Quick opening review: 15 minutes** (just principles, not deep theory)

**Evening Session (90 minutes):**
- [x] **Play 1-2 games: 45 minutes** (15+10 rapid)
- [x] **Game analysis: 45 minutes** (analyse WITHOUT engine first, like your plan says)

**Opening approach (Capablanca-style):**
- Stick to 1-2 simple systems (Italian Game from your plan is perfect)
- Focus on **understanding the ideas** rather than memorizing moves
- Your Finegold notes: "Realise why the openings are played"

**Weekly addition:**
- One longer game on weekends (30+0) to practice converting your endgame knowledge
