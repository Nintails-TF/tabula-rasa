# Caro-Kann

The Caro-Kann is a solid and safe opening for black which fights for the centre in a traditional way.

## Main Ideas:

- Space in the centre
- Bishop development, unlike the French Defence.
- Endgame advantages - fits with Capablanca's theories.
- Counterplay - you can counter attack and play actively as the black pieces.
