# Blunder Checklist:

- [ ] Check all opponent's pieces - any hanging?
- [ ] Check all my pieces - any hanging after my move?
- [ ] Does this move create a weakness?
- [ ] Am I moving the same piece twice in opening?

# Capture Protocol:

2. How does each capture affect pawn structure? 
3. Which piece needs development? 
4. What's my opponent's best reply to each?
