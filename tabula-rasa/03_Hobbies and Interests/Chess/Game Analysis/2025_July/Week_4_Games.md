# [NintailsChess (778) VS supersexman (787)](https://www.chess.com/analysis/game/live/141023276760/analysis)

Date: 23/07/25
Time Control: 15 + 10
Pieces: White
Opening: Queen's Gambit that transposed into the Indian Game, then Pirc Defence
Result: Win

Critical Positions: (diagram or notation)
1. Position after move 5: 
   - My plan: I struck in the centre with e5, since I had 2 attackers on that square, they had 1 defender and I could have a dominant centre.
   - Their plan: To play in an King's Indian style and slowly develop pieces by fianchettoing them.
   - What I missed: I took with the bishop rather than the pawn, so my attack didn't instantly threaten his knight to move. Which made my attack much worse as it was slow.
2. Move 16: Nb4??
	1. My opponent hung their knight, it did weaken my king, but because my minor and heavy pieces were close, my king was never in any real danger.
	2. What I missed: I could of threatened his king much earlier with Qh6, it isn't mate, but it puts him under lots of stress, I can win pawns and then I can slide back to help my king again.

Blunders/Mistakes:
- Move 15: I didn't think about using a pawn storm on the king side and ramming my h pawn into his king's pawn structure.
- Why: I've never really launched a pawn storm before, because I don't normally castle queenside.

Key Learning:
- Opening: Think carefully before deciding what piece to take with, if you can attack a piece with a pawn and force a response, usually that's the best option.
- Middlegame: Good job playing solid and not making obvious mistakes. Keep in mind the power of pawn storms. My middle game plan sort of boiled down to pushing a pawn down the centre of the board, I think it would of been better to look at where he was weak, and strike there.
- Endgame: N/A

One thing to remember: *Playing even inaccurate moves, as long as you don't make obvious mistakes sometimes is enough to win. Not blundering is important.*

# [NintailsChess (785) VS vicking7006 (711)](https://www.chess.com/analysis/game/live/141027954770/analysis)


Date: 23/07/25
Time Control: 15+10
Pieces: White
Opening: Italian opening, into a Philidor defence which transpose into a scotch.

Critical Positions: 

c4 in the opening would of been much better, I would have centre domination.

After move 10, he castled queenside and after my previous note, I see that I can launch a pawn storm, so I start barrelling my h-pawn up the board.

I should of recognised that putting my knight on e6 was an outpost, I had many chances to rout my knight there, but didn't, it would of been a monster knight.

Blunders/Mistakes:
- Move 17: Nxa7??
- Why: I ended up sacking my knight to try open up his kingside, since my pawn was knocking on his door, but there was no reason to, I could of slowed down and got my queen to c3 and doubled attacked the base of his pawn chain which would of been much better.

Key Learning:
- Opening: Keeping the tension and not being afraid of moving my c-pawn to fight for centre ahead of minor pieces if it is sensible, which is this case it was.
- Middlegame: Look at key squares you can access and try and take them. Don't tunnel vision on a single idea, but again, look at placing your pieces on strong squares, where they control key positional lynchpins
- Endgame: N/A

One thing to remember: *Pawn storms are good, but you don't tunnel vision on the idea, use the pressure from the pawn to develop other pieces to natural squares and build up an attack. Also don't sac pieces unless you have calculated that you are going to get it back.*

# [NintailsChess VS Swetalsuthar10](https://www.chess.com/analysis/game/pgn/UzSyM6mEe/analysis)


Date: 23/07/25
Time Control: 15+10
Pieces: Black
Opening: Caro-Kann Defence

Critical Positions: 

Move 7: Nc6 - Pushing my f-pawn to strike at the knight would have been stronger, as I could of added attackers to the pinned piece and try immediately win material, but it would break opening principles so I avoided it.

Move 12: e5?! - Grabbing centre control like this is a principled idea, but it gives white many tricky tactics as the pawn e is now weak and the d pawn is also weak. I'd have to push my f-pawn, which I don't want to do. White can threaten a pin with a rook, so giving him this option isn't good

Move 13: a6?? - Not realising tactically that the knight was trapped by his own bishop and playing either f5 or h5 to take it for free.


Key Learning:
- Opening: Breaking opening principles is OK if you get compensation for it.
- Middlegame: Think about pawn structure, and keeping your centre pawns strong, even if you take less space.
- Endgame: Be solid with technique, think deeply about mating or shutting down all counterplay.

One thing to remember: *Keep an eye out for tactical opportunities. Perhaps develop techniques to look for them and spot them.*

# Chess Game Review Template


Date: 24/07/25
Time Control: 15+10
Pieces: White
Opening: Queen's Gambit into King's Indian Defence

Critical Positions: 
- c5?! - I take towards the centre with my c pawn, but this loses me a pawn or castling rights for my king, both of which aren't good.
- Qc1? - Taking with my queen rather than the bishop ruins my kingside pawn structure. Black can win 2 pawns, he only finds 1 of them and I'm lucky he doesn't punish me.
- When I push my pawns, I need to keep them connected so they are defended. I rushed it and slammed one up the board which my opponent could of punished if they were better.

Blunders/Mistakes:
Key mistake was not taking with my dark-squared bishop. The protocol would be look at the piece I can capture and think through what the best piece to capture would be with. I could of avoided doubled-isolated pawns.

Key Learning:
- Opening: Capturing towards the centre isn't always the best idea.
- Middlegame: Think of what the best pieces to capture with are.
- Endgame: Keep past pawns connected and don't rush the endgame.

One thing to remember: *When you have multiple captures on a piece, think of which the best options are!*

# [NintailsChess VS PapaGroundHog](https://www.chess.com/analysis/game/live/141066535550/analysis)


Date: 24/07/25
Time Control: 15+10
Pieces: Black
Opening: Caro-Kann

Critical Positions: 
- 8. b5!? - The problem with this move, is that white has the reply of a5 and it hurts my position. It doesn't develop a piece or directly fight for centre which is more key in this opening position. Routing my static knight to c6. Rc8 is also good. I didn't see that reply to my move. I always seem to underestimate pawns.
- 9. Qb6? - The issue with this queen move though it seems natural, is the fact that the combination of dxc5, bxc5, then b4. Makes the queen a target and gives white lots of tempo and space to play with. Putting me on the back foot if he sees this pawn break idea.
- 12. Qxc5? - Why am I not taking with the bishop, it is free development??? White can then attack my queen and win tempo. Just a very bad move, and after I said not to do so.

Key Learning:
- Opening: Focus on piece development if you have time and no obvious tactic.
- Middlegame: Look at threats your opponent can potentially make.
- Endgame: Offering a queen trade is good, but don't let him make developing moves whilst blocking your queen. Focus on any actual threats you can make.

One thing to remember: *Focus on development of the pieces in the opening.*
