# U1400 Opening Principles with GM Ben Finegold:

- When bad things happen, you've got to fix it and ensure it doesn't happen again.
	- Don't do the same thing every game, that is how you stagnate.
- If a grandmaster says, don't do something. You don't do it.
- Good answers to making moves.
	- I'm controlling the centre.
	- I'm moving bishops and knights out.
	- I put my rook on an open file.
	- I castled.
	- I gained space.
- Bad answers
	- I'm attacking a piece, I hope he doesn't see it.
	- I'm threatening a tactic, I hope he doesn't see it.
	- I don't know why.
- Most of a GMs moves don't directly threaten an opponents pieces, but play moves that improves their position.
- Attacking a piece isn't an opening principle!
	- If your opponent makes a dubious move, you don't need to attack it. You need to get your pieces out first, if you can do both, then great. But don't have one-move-itus and attack an opponent without a real threat.
- The Morphy Opera game shows the concept of how making nonsense moves loses you the game, black attacks the c4 bishop with a pawn, but it doesn't improve his position, it is an empty threat.
- Be exciting by winning free pieces not by making attacking moves.
- There is a big difference between making moves on the kingside of the board and the queenside of the board.
	- An example is the Grunfeld defence, in which if you play that on the queenside, black is losing.
- Realise why the openings are played. For instance: Queen's Gambit. 
	- If white could, he'd play d4, e4. But since black doesn't want white to have a dominant centre, black plays d5/Nf6 to stop e4.
	- So we play c4 and if black accepts the gambit, we can play e4.
	- Otherwise black can go c6 (slav) or e6 (QCD). 
	- Nf6 doesn't work since white can capture and remove your centre pawn. 
- When your queen is attacked, move it away.
- Sometimes you end up breaking opening principles, because you've got something more important to do. For example:
	- Taking pieces is more important.
	- If both players break opening principles, it isn't clear who is winning.
- Look for checks and captures. If a move does both, it's likely worth.
- If you can break a principle that causes your opponent to break a principle, then it can be worth.
- e4 is usually followed by Nf3, but d4 isn't followed by Nc3.
	- This is because white usually, wants to play either c4 or c3 in the future, but pushing your f-pawn is risky.
- When the centre is blocked up, you want to use the C pawn and sometimes the f-pawn to break it open. Don't have your knights gum up the position.
- Don't make moves that stop you from making other moves.
- When it happens once, stop it so it doesn't happen again.
- Imagine you have a coach, if you can't explain the move to a coach or GM, then it's no use.
