# The Bishop Pair:


- Two bishops much better than two knights.
	- Unless pawn structure or bad bishops. Basically 2 knights need some other resource to be better than a bishop pair.
	- This is because bishops control more squares than the knights do.
- You can get away with weakening your king a bit more, if you opponent has no bishops.
- Trading down pieces could even be worth.
	- You can trade down the bishop when your opponent doesn't expect it to gain value.
- Your opponent SHOULD stop you from getting 2 bishops, but it doesn't mean they will if they don't understand chess.
- A bishop that is blockaded isn't very useful. e.g. Lisa Simpson bishop.
- Removing queens can kill a lot of mating attacks.
- When you are bishop pair vs a knight and bishop.
	- Keep the bishop that is opposite colour to your opponent, as it can rule the world.
	- But if you trade all pieces and end up in an endgame with 1 bishop vs 2 bishops, it is a draw.
- Think: "How can I shut out all possible counterplay?" when you are in a winning position. You want to clamp down on the throat and squish any life out of the position.
- Knights are tricky bastards, but bishops are clearly superior for the strong player.
- Bishops can work together to trap knights.
