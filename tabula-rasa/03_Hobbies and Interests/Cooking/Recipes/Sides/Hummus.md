# Hummus Recipe

## Ingredients
- 1 can (15 oz) chickpeas/garbanzo beans, drained and rinsed
- 1/4 cup fresh lemon juice (about 1 large lemon)
- 1/4 cup tahini (sesame paste)
- 2 garlic cloves, minced (1 garlic clove for less garlic taste)
- 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus one tablespoon on top for serving
- 1 teaspoon ground cumin
- Salt to taste
- 2 tablespoons water
- Dash of ground paprika for serving

## Instructions

1. In a food processor, combine the tahini and lemon juice. Process for 1 minute until creamy and whipped.
2. Add the olive oil, minced garlic, cumin, and 1/2 teaspoon of salt. Process for 30 seconds, scrape sides, then process 30 seconds more.
3. Add half the chickpeas and process for 1 minute. Scrape sides and add remaining chickpeas, processing until thick and smooth, 1-2 minutes.
4. With the processor running, slowly add 2-3 tablespoons of water until you reach your desired consistency.
5. Taste and adjust seasoning - add more salt, lemon juice, or garlic as needed.
6. Serve drizzled with olive oil and a sprinkle of paprika.

## Tips

- For extra smooth hummus, peel the chickpeas by rubbing them in a kitchen towel
- Make it ahead - flavours improve after a few hours in the fridge
- Keeps for up to one week refrigerated
- May need to process in two batches depending on food processor size
