Saturday - Cardio:
I do a 5km run each Saturday with Cameron, if he isn't busy. I'll sometimes walk this depending on how I feel, it's harder to motivate myself if he isn't there though.

Sunday - Cardio or rest:
I either do some more cardio or I should do some stretching and mobility work to prepare for Monday.
