# Factors Influencing Strength:

**Physical dimensions (Training or Stimulus Aspect)**
- **Power** - the ability to generate force quickly (explosive strength).
- **Endurance** - sustaining effort over time, which differs from pure cardiovascular fitness.
- **Flexibility and mobility** - maintaining range of motion under load.
- **Balance and proprioception** - spatial awareness and stability.
- **Bone density** - structural strength that supports everything else.

**Mental/cognitive aspects: (Mind and Muscle Connection)**
- **Focus and concentration** - maintaining attention under physical stress.
- **Pain tolerance** - managing discomfort without compromising performance.
- **Confidence** - believing in your capabilities affects actual performance.
- **Adaptability** - adjusting to unexpected challenges or changing conditions.

**Skill-based strength (Domain Specific Strength):**
- **Technique proficiency** - efficient movement patterns that maximize force output.
- **Body awareness** - understanding how to engage muscles optimally.
- **Coordination** - integrating different muscle groups smoothly.

**Systemic factors (Recovery and Biological Optimization):**
- **Recovery capacity** - how quickly you bounce back from stress.
- **Metabolic efficiency** - how well your energy systems function.
- **Hormonal health** - affects everything from motivation to muscle building.

## Developing Systems:

In my mind the best way forward would be to pick a few of these that are interconnected and integral to my goals and working on them before moving to less critical components.

**Muscular strength and technique** are the golden standard since they provide visible progress and ensure safety. Beyond this, you'd have **mental resilience and recovery** that are the next two important features.

Building a cardiovascular base takes time and consistent effort, so it's best to start with doing that and cross training lifting to build muscle.
