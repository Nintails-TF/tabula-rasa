# Diet Plan

# Diet Plan: Fitness & Anti-Inflammation Focus

## Current Status

- **Calories**: 2300/day (cutting phase)
- **Protein**: 140g/day
- **Goal**: Maintain muscle while cutting.
- **Strategy**: Increase calories gradually if strength plateaus

## Core Nutritional Principles

### Anti-Inflammatory Focus

Target nutrients for reducing inflammation:

- **Omega-3 fatty acids** (EPA/DHA from fish, ALA from plants)
- **Antioxidants** (Vitamins A, C, E, polyphenols)
- **Vitamin K** (K1 from greens, K2 from fermented foods)
- **Specialized compounds** (Sulforaphane, anthocyanins, curcumin)

### EPO Enhancement

For improved oxygen-carrying capacity:

- **Iron** + Vitamin C (for plant sources)
- **Vitamin B12** & **Folate** (B9)
- **Copper** (to balance zinc supplementation)

## Food Hierarchy for Anti-Inflammation

### Tier 1: Most Potent Anti-Inflammatory Foods

1. **Fatty Fish** (2-3x/week)
    - Salmon, mackerel, sardines
    - Direct EPA/DHA omega-3s
2. **Berries** (1 cup daily)
    - Blueberries, blackberries, strawberries
    - High anthocyanin content
3. **Turmeric + Black Pepper** (1-2 tsp daily)
    - Curcumin absorption increased 2000% with pepper
4. **Extra Virgin Olive Oil** (2-3 tbsp daily)
    - Contains oleocanthal (natural ibuprofen-like compound)
5. **Tart Cherries** (1 cup or 240-350ml juice daily)
    - Exceptional for exercise-induced inflammation

### Tier 2: Strong Anti-Inflammatory Foods

- **Leafy Greens** (2-3 cups daily): Kale, spinach, Swiss chard
- **Walnuts** (1-2 oz daily): Highest omega-3 content among nuts
- **Cruciferous Vegetables** (1-2 cups daily): Broccoli, Brussels sprouts
- **Ginger** (1-2 tsp fresh daily): Inhibits inflammatory enzymes
- **Green Tea** (3-4 cups daily): EGCG and catechins

### Tier 3: Supporting Anti-Inflammatory Foods

- **Fermented Foods** (1/2 cup daily): Yogurt, kefir, kimchi, sauerkraut
- **Avocados** (1/2-1 daily): Monounsaturated fats
- **Dark Chocolate** (85%+, 20-30g daily): Copper source, flavanols
- **Garlic & Onions** (1-2 cloves/1/4 cup daily): Organosulfur compounds

## Macronutrient Sources

### Protein (Ranked by Quality & Cost-Efficiency)

#### Animal Proteins

|Food|Protein/100g|Protein/Â£|Notes|
|---|---|---|---|
|Chicken Breast|31g|47.69g|Lean, versatile|
|Eggs|12g|43.64g|Complete protein + K2|
|Greek Yogurt|10g|44.44g|Probiotics bonus|
|Fatty Fish|20-25g|Variable|Omega-3 rich|
|Lean Ground Beef|26g|43.48g|Limit 1-2x/week|

#### Plant Proteins

|Food|Protein/100g|Protein/Â£|Notes|
|---|---|---|---|
|Lentils (dry)|24g|93.02g|Best value + fiber|
|Beans (canned)|7g|47.46g|Resistant starch|
|Tofu|12g|30.19g|Complete protein|

### Carbohydrates (For Training Energy)

#### Complex Carbs - Primary

- **Oats**: Beta-glucan fiber, avenanthramides
- **Sweet Potatoes**: Beta-carotene, moderate GI
- **Quinoa**: Complete protein, quercetin
- **Brown Rice**: Neutral inflammation, budget-friendly

#### Pre-Workout Options

- **Wholewheat Pasta**: Higher fiber than white, good for endurance
- **Bananas**: Quick energy, potassium

### Healthy Fats

- **Primary**: Extra virgin olive oil, avocados
- **Nuts/Seeds**: Walnuts, almonds, chia, pumpkin seeds
	- Not flaxseed, since it is mildly androgenic.
- **Moderation**: Grass-fed butter, coconut oil

## Supplementation Protocol

### Core Performance Stack

1. **Creatine Monohydrate**: 5g daily (anytime)
2. **Omega-3**: 360mg EPA, 240mg DHA daily
3. **Vitamin D**: 4000 IU daily
4. **ZMA** (before bed): 4.3mg B6, 186mg Magnesium, 12mg Zinc

### Additional Considerations

- **Manuka Honey**: MGO 300-850 for immune support
- **Bone Broth**: Joint health (especially for Iceland training)

## Practical Meal Planning

### Daily Targets

- **Vegetables**: 5-7 servings (emphasize variety/color)
- **Protein**: 140g minimum (0.8-1g per lb bodyweight)
- **Water**: 3-4L daily, more during training
- **Anti-inflammatory foods**: Include at least 3 Tier 1 foods daily

### Training-Specific Adjustments

- **High-intensity days**: +300-500 calories, emphasize carbs
- **Iceland prep**: Increase electrolytes, focus on joint-supporting foods
- **Cutting phase**: Maintain protein, reduce fats/carbs proportionally

### Foods to Minimize

- Processed meats (high in inflammatory compounds)
- Refined carbs and sugary foods
- Trans fats and hydrogenated oils
- Excessive omega-6 oils (corn, soybean)

## Key Combinations for Maximum Benefit

- **Iron + Vitamin C**: Spinach + citrus, lentils + tomatoes
- **Turmeric + Black Pepper + Fat**: Golden milk or curry dishes
- **Zinc + Copper Balance**: Supplement zinc, eat dark chocolate/pumpkin seeds
- **Calcium timing**: Avoid with iron-rich meals
