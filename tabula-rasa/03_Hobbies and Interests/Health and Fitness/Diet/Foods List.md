### Iron:

Iron supports oxygen transportation, immune function, energy production, cognitive health and DNA synthesis.

When eating foods that are iron-rich, pair them with foods high in vitamin C to increase the absorption of iron. 

Animal sources of iron are classed as **heme-iron** and are more bioavalible (easily absorbed by the body). Plant sources *(Non-heme)* are also solid too, but you'd want to consume them with vitamin C rich food since their absorption rate is lower.

Avoid eating calcium rich foods at the same time, calcium inhibits iron absorption. Also, tea and coffee contain polyphenols which inhibit the absorption of iron.
