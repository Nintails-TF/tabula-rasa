# Summary:

- Total weekly distance of 25-30 kilometres (15-18 miles)
	- Increase by no more than 10% per week.
- Mix of different types of runs:
    - 1 longer run (8-10K) Zone 2
    - 1-2 moderate runs (5-7K) Zone 2-3
    - 1 shorter, easier recovery run (3-5K) Zone 1-2
- Training for half-marathon (21.1km)
	- Need a volume of around 40-50km. So 10-12 week build up.

80% of your training should be at zone 1-2, 20% should be at zones 2-3

> LISS for recovery, fat loss and longevity. (Ideal for warmups and cooldowns)
> MISS for balanced endurance training.
> HIIT for efficient training and VO2 max. (Best for athletes and extreme conditions)

My Ranges:

| Training Zone                | % of MHR | Heart Rate Range (bpm) |
| ---------------------------- | -------- | ---------------------- |
| Zone 1 (Recovery)            | 50-60%   | 99-118                 |
| Zone 2 (Fat Burn/Aerobic)    | 60-70%   | 118-138                |
| Zone 3 (Aerobic/Moderate)    | 70-80%   | 138-158                |
| Zone 4 (Anaerobic Threshold) | 80-90%   | 158-177                |
| Zone 5 (Maximum Effort)      | 90-100%  | 177-197                |

# Cardiovascular Zones:

### Zone 1 - Recovery:

The purpose of zone 1 is to act as active recovery by improving circulation of blood and aiding muscle repair. It is useful as also building an aerobic base with less fatigue.

Mainly, it should be used as a tool for:
- Recovery.
- Warm-ups and Cool-downs.
- Improving Longevity.

### Zone 2 - Fat Burn / Aerobic Base:

The purpose of zone 2 is building a strong aerobic foundation, it is ideal when used as LISS for this reason and is a great way of enhancing cardiovascular efficiency; so your heart and lungs become more well oiled and maintained.

Zone 2 is ideal at burning fat as well, since at this level of intensity the body prioritises fat as fuel, not carbohydrates.

Mainly, zone 2 should be used for:
- LISS Endurance training.
- Fat loss.
- Building an aerobic foundation.

### Zone 3 - Aerobic / Moderate:

Zone 3 is an ideal balance between endurance and intensity, the shift between aerobic state uses both fat and carbs for fuel. Zone 3 is ideal at overall cardio endurance.

It is a balance between Aerobic and is on the edge of being anaerobic.

Zone 3 should be used for:
- MISS endurance training.
- Building endurance without fatigue
- More carb usage.
- Preparation for high-intensity work.

### Zone 4 - Anaerobic Threshold:

At zone 4, the body is working close to the lactate threshold, so this only can be sustained for a limited time before fatigue sets in. Think about sprint training.

Zone 4 is mainly used to increase the duration in which you can perform high-intensity efforts.

Zone 4 should be used for:
- HIIT intervals
- Race pace training for cardio athletes (runners, cyclists, rowers)

### Zone 5 - Max Effort:

Zone 5 is the limit of the body, it is totally anaerobic, meaning that you need stored ATP and glycogen for a short burst of power. The benefits of zone 5 are developing explosive power and tolerating extreme exertion.

Zone 5 should be used for:
- Spiriting
- Explosive HIIT
- VO2 max training

# Cardiovascular Training - Methods:

Calculating your MHR (Max Heart Rate), you can use various formulas.

| Method                                  | Formula                            | Notes                                                      | My MHR |
| --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ------ |
| **General Method (Fox, 1971)**          | `MHR = 220 - Age`                  | Based on observational data, not precise.                  | 198    |
| **Norwegian Method (Nes et al , 2013)** | `MHR = 211 - (0.64 × Age)` (Men)   | More accurate for men                                      | 197    |
|                                         | `MHR = 210 - (0.67 × Age)` (Women) | More accurate for women                                    | N/A    |
| **Tanaka Formula (Tanaka, 2001)**       | `MHR = 208 - (0.7 × Age)`          | Based on a study of 18,000 subjects. Better for those 40+. | 193    |

### *LISS (Low-Intensity-Steady-State):*

LISS is ideally used for Fat burning, endurance training, recovery days and longevity. I see LISS as a great way to start endurance training.

LISS is classified as 50% to 65% of your MHR., it should fall between zone 1-2 of your aerobic capacity.

### *MISS (Moderate-Intensity-Steady-State):*

MISS is a balance between lower state exercise and high intensity exercise. It is ideal for a balance between intensity and recovery.

It is classified as 65% to 75% of your MHR, It should fall into zone 2-3. 

### *HIIT (High-Intensity-Interval-Training):*

HIIT is a very effective method of burning calories and improving anaerobic capacity. It improves VO2 max and increases metabolism post workout (EPOC effect). The problem is that it requires more recovery, is harder on joints and raises the risk of injury.

HIIT is classified as 80%-100% of your MHR and would place you into zone 4-5.
